## 2. Critical Network Security Issues

### 2.1 Unrestricted Internet Access

#### 2.1.1 Issue Details

**Security Impact: CRITICAL**

Unrestricted internet access to multiple services creates a substantial attack surface, enabling potential attackers to directly target vulnerable services from anywhere on the internet. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and service compromise.

| Security Group | Service/Purpose | Critical Exposures | Associated Systems |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| sg-1bd4787f (allOpen) | Unknown | ALL TCP ports (0-65535) open to 0.0.0.0/0 | Unknown |
| sg-0fa30e9feec49f425 | CentOS 7 | ALL TRAFFIC (ALL PORTS) to 0.0.0.0/0 | Unknown |
| sg-ac1ad1cb | Windows Nano | ALL TRAFFIC (ALL PORTS) to 0.0.0.0/0 | idanbean-windows-nano |
| sg-6fdb1208 | Windows | ALL TRAFFIC (ALL PORTS) to 0.0.0.0/0 | idanbean_windows |
| sg-36048f51 | launch-wizard-7 | ALL TCP ports (0-65535) to 0.0.0.0/0 | Unknown |
| sg-07b02f46e3d0fedcc | Internal ALB | ALL TCP ports (0-65535) to 0.0.0.0/0 | Canlead-Internal-ALB |

**Additional Exposed Security Groups:**
- 58 additional security groups with more limited but still concerning internet exposure
- Complete list available in Appendix A

#### 2.1.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Remove ALL TRAFFIC allow rules from sg-0fa30e9feec49f425, sg-ac1ad1cb, sg-6fdb1208
   - Restrict all other security groups to allow only necessary ports from specific IP addresses

2. **Additional Improvements:**
   - Implement jump server/bastion host architecture for administrative access
   - Use security group referencing instead of direct internet access where possible
   - Document all required external access with business justification

3. **Implementation Guidance:**
   ```bash
   # Example AWS CLI command to remove all traffic rule
   aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress \
       --group-id sg-0fa30e9feec49f425 \
       --protocol all \
       --port 0-65535 \
       --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   
   # Example to add restricted access
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
       --group-id sg-0fa30e9feec49f425 \
       --protocol tcp \
       --port 443 \
       --cidr 122.116.225.155/32
   ```

### 2.2 Insecure Protocols Exposed

#### 2.2.1 Issue Details

**Security Impact: CRITICAL**

Multiple insecure protocols are directly accessible from the internet, creating significant security risks. These protocols often transmit data in cleartext or have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.

| Protocol | Exposure | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Telnet (TCP/23) | 6 security groups | Plaintext transmission of credentials and data |
| FTP (TCP/21) | 9 security groups | Plaintext authentication and data transfer |
| MySQL (TCP/3306) | 11 security groups | Unencrypted database access if not configured properly |
| MSSQL (TCP/1433) | 8 security groups | Potential for SQL injection and data exposure |
| RDP (TCP/3389) | 10 security groups | Target for brute force attacks if not restricted |
| SMTP (TCP/25) | 7 security groups | Potential mail relay abuse if not secured |
| SSH (TCP/22) | 42 security groups | Common target for brute force attacks |

**Most Concerning Examples:**
- sg-1bd4787f (allOpen): All insecure protocols accessible
- sg-0f1c8699dd4f51575 (SG-MailServer): Exposing POP3/SMTP/IMAP directly to internet
- sg-0545ed506b8930369: Exposing FTP (both TCP/UDP) to internet

#### 2.2.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Replace Telnet with SSH where remote access is required
   - Replace FTP with SFTP/FTPS for file transfers
   - Restrict database access to VPN or specific trusted IPs only

2. **Additional Improvements:**
   - Implement TLS for mail services
   - Use VPN or dedicated private connections for database access
   - Enable additional authentication mechanisms (certificates, IP restrictions)

3. **Technical Guidance:**
   - For databases: Use SSL/TLS connections, implement connection encryption
   - For file transfers: Standardize on SFTP (port 22) with key-based authentication
   - For remote administration: Use VPN + RDP rather than direct RDP exposure

## 3. Authentication and Access Control Issues

### 3.1 Missing Multi-Factor Authentication

#### 3.1.1 Issue Details

**Security Impact: CRITICAL**

Multiple AWS IAM users lack MFA, creating significant risk of account compromise through password-based attacks. MFA is an essential security control for privileged accounts, particularly those with administrative access.

| User | Access Type | Last Console Login | Access Keys | Risk Factors |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Johnny_howcool | Console (Password) | 2024-12-10 | Active key unused since Mar 2023 | • Console access without MFA<br>• Unused access key |
| mgc.paul.dev@gmail.com | Console (Password) | 2024-05-30 | Two active keys | • Console access without MFA<br>• Multiple access keys |
| callcarbar | API only | N/A | Active key in use | • Long-term API key since 2017<br>• No key rotation |
| [Additional users...] | | | | |

**Total Exposure:**
- 2 users with console access lacking MFA
- 9 additional service accounts with programmatic access lacking MFA
- Multiple stale access keys that remain active

#### 3.1.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Enable MFA for all users with console access
   - Rotate or disable any unused access keys
   - Validate necessity of all service accounts

2. **Technical Implementation:**
   ```bash
   # AWS CLI commands to check MFA status
   aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices
   
   # AWS CLI to list access keys and last used date
   aws iam list-access-keys --user-name Johnny_howcool
   aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id AKIA[REDACTED-ACCESS-KEY]
   ```

| System | Environment | Last Update | Critical Missing Updates |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| AWS-DB1 | Cloud | > 90 days | Unknown |
| EC2AMAZ-5RNE6MK | Cloud | > 90 days | Unknown |
| EC2AMAZ-BEI6GLN | Cloud | > 90 days | Unknown |
| WEB1-WEB4 | Cloud | > 90 days | Unknown |
| USER3095 | On-premises | Windows Update inactive | Unknown |

#### 4.1.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Inventory all missing updates for affected systems
   - Prioritize critical security updates for immediate application
   - Create maintenance window for update deployment

2. **Additional Improvements:**
   - Implement automated patch management
   - Establish regular patching schedule
   - Document exceptions with compensating controls

### 4.2 SMBv1 Protocol Enabled

#### 4.2.1 Issue Details

**Security Impact: HIGH**

SMBv1 is an outdated, insecure protocol vulnerable to various attacks including the infamous WannaCry ransomware. Microsoft has deprecated this protocol and recommends disabling it in all environments.

**Affected Systems:**
- USER8088 (192.168.8.88): SMBv1 enabled with port 445 exposed
- 28 customer service workstations in the 192.168.3.0/24 network with SMBv1 enabled

**Security Implications:**
- Vulnerability to wormable malware like WannaCry/EternalBlue
- Lack of encryption and modern authentication
- No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

#### 4.2.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Disable SMBv1 on all workstations via Group Policy
   ```powershell
   # PowerShell command to disable SMBv1
   Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol
   ```
   - Verify no applications require SMBv1

2. **Group Policy Implementation:**
   - Configure SMB security via GPO for all domain-joined systems
   - Test application compatibility before full deployment
   - Monitor for attempted SMBv1 connections to identify legacy systems

## 5. Logging and Monitoring Issues

### 5.1 Insufficient Log Retention

#### 5.1.1 Issue Details

**Security Impact: CRITICAL**

Several log storage systems have retention periods far below industry standards and security best practices. Without sufficient log history, security investigations are hampered, and compliance requirements cannot be met.

| Log Storage | Current Retention | Recommended | Gap |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| aws-cloudtrail-logs-366205796862-993f53a6 | No lifecycle policy | 365 days minimum | Undefined retention |
| callcarbar-log | 30 days | 365 days minimum | 335 days |
| canlead-ecs-log | 14 days | 365 days minimum | 351 days |

**Security Impact:**
- Inability to investigate past security incidents
- Loss of evidence for forensic analysis
- Non-compliance with security standards requiring 1-year retention

#### 5.1.2 Remediation Steps

1. **Priority Actions:**
   - Configure S3 lifecycle rules for CloudTrail logs
   ```json
   {
     "Rules": [
       {
         "Status": "Enabled",
         "Prefix": "",
         "Expiration": {
           "Days": 365
         },
         "ID": "CloudTrail-Logs-Retention"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Update retention policies for application logs

2. **Implementation Guidance:**
   - Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier for cost-effective long-term storage
   - Consider log aggregation to a central SIEM for better analysis
   - Document retention requirements and verification procedures
