# Milestone M01: GCP PCI DSS Scripts Refactoring

## Overview
Refactor the GCP PCI DSS assessment scripts to eliminate code duplication, improve maintainability, and create a modular framework for compliance checks.

## Business Context
Current GCP scripts have 40-60% code duplication across 9 requirement scripts (~8,100 total lines), resulting in:
- High maintenance overhead (9x effort for bug fixes)
- Inconsistent user experience
- Risk of implementation drift
- Difficulty adding new requirements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 68% reduction in total codebase (from ~8,100 to ~2,600 lines)
- [ ] Eliminate code duplication through shared libraries
- [ ] Standardized CLI interface across all scripts
- [ ] Consistent error handling and reporting
- [ ] Plugin architecture for new requirements
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

## Target Deliverables
1. **Shared Library Framework** - Common functions for authentication, logging, reporting
2. **Refactored Requirement Scripts** - All 8 scripts using shared libraries
3. **Unified CLI Interface** - Consistent command-line experience
4. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Centralized error management
5. **Documentation Update** - Updated usage guides and examples

## Timeline
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 sprints

## Dependencies
- Existing GCP PCI DSS scripts (8 requirement scripts)
- GCP PCI DSS Framework Refactoring PRD
- Bash scripting environment with gcloud CLI

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk:** Ensuring backward compatibility during refactoring
- **Low Risk:** Maintaining assessment accuracy across all requirements
