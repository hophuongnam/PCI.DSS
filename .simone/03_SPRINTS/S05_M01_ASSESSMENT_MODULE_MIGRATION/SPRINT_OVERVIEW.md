# Sprint: Assessment Module Migration (S05)

## Sprint Goal
Complete the assessment module extraction by migrating all remaining requirements into modular architecture, achieving full plugin-based assessment system.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Complete Assessment Module Migration** - Extract remaining 4-5 assessment modules
  - `assessments/requirement_3_checks.sh`, `requirement_4_checks.sh`, etc.
  - Total extraction: ~1500 lines of assessment logic into modular format
  - All assessment logic moved from monolithic scripts to dedicated modules
- **Full Plugin Architecture Integration** - Complete modular assessment system
  - All 8 assessment modules working through plugin framework
  - Cross-module data sharing and aggregation capabilities
  - Module dependency management if needed
- **Comprehensive Integration Testing** - Validate complete modular system
  - End-to-end testing of all requirements through modular architecture
  - Performance validation across all modules
  - Regression testing against original script behavior
- **Module Optimization** - Performance and efficiency improvements
  - Code optimization within extracted modules
  - Resource usage optimization for large-scale assessments

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] All 8 assessment modules successfully extracted and functional
- [ ] Complete plugin architecture operational for all PCI DSS requirements
- [ ] All modules integrate correctly with shared libraries and configuration
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing passes for all requirements
- [ ] Performance testing shows modular system matches original script performance
- [ ] Cross-module functionality (if any) working correctly
- [ ] All assessment logic successfully migrated from monolithic scripts
- [ ] System ready for script refactoring phase

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint S04 (Assessment Module Architecture)
- **Focus:** This completes the plugin architecture implementation
- **Value:** Provides complete modular assessment system, enabling final script refactoring
- **Risk:** Must ensure all assessment logic is preserved during migration
