# Sprint: Script Refactoring & Integration (S06)

## Sprint Goal
Complete the milestone by refactoring all 8 requirement scripts to use shared infrastructure, achieving the 68% code reduction target and full system integration.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Complete Script Refactoring** - Transform all 8 requirement scripts
  - Reduce each script from ~900 lines to ~50 lines (6,800 line reduction total)
  - Scripts become orchestration layers using shared libraries
  - Maintain all existing CLI interfaces and backward compatibility
- **System Integration** - Full integration of all components
  - Scripts + shared libraries + configuration + assessment modules working together
  - End-to-end testing of complete refactored system
  - Integration with existing build and deployment processes
- **Performance Validation** - Ensure performance requirements met
  - Execution time within 10% of original scripts
  - Memory usage under 100MB per script
  - Scalability testing for 1000+ project organizations
- **Final Testing & Documentation** - Complete system validation
  - Comprehensive regression testing against original functionality
  - User acceptance testing for CLI interface consistency
  - Complete documentation update for refactored architecture

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] All 8 requirement scripts refactored to ~50 lines each using shared infrastructure
- [ ] 68% code reduction target achieved (from 7,740 to ~2,600 lines)
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for all existing CLI interfaces
- [ ] Performance requirements met (within 10% execution time, <100MB memory)
- [ ] Complete integration testing passes for all requirements
- [ ] Regression testing confirms identical functionality to original scripts
- [ ] User acceptance testing validates CLI interface consistency
- [ ] System scalability validated for large organization scopes
- [ ] Complete documentation updated for refactored architecture
- [ ] Milestone Definition of Done fully satisfied

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint S05 (Assessment Module Migration)
- **Focus:** This completes the entire milestone and achieves all DoD criteria
- **Value:** Delivers the complete 68% code reduction and maintainability improvement
- **Risk:** Critical to maintain exact functional equivalence with original scripts
- **Milestone Completion:** This sprint delivers the final milestone objectives
