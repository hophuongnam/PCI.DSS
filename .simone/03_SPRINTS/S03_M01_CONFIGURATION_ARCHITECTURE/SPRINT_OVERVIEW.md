# Sprint: Configuration-Driven Architecture (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Implement configuration-driven behavior system by creating requirement configuration files and configuration loading framework, enabling externalized configuration management.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Configuration Directory Structure** - Create `config/` directory with organized configuration management
- **8 Requirement Configuration Files** (20 lines Ã— 8 = 160 lines total)
  - `config/requirement_1.conf` through `config/requirement_8.conf`
  - Each containing: REQUIREMENT_NUMBER, REQUIREMENT_TITLE, REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS, ASSESSMENT_FUNCTIONS
  - Extracted from hardcoded values in existing scripts
- **Configuration Loading Framework** - Integration in shared libraries
  - load_requirement_config() function in gcp_common.sh
  - Configuration validation and error handling
  - Default value handling and override capabilities
- **Configuration Testing** - Validation of configuration system
- **Documentation** - Configuration management guide and examples

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] `config/` directory structure created and organized
- [ ] All 8 requirement configuration files created with complete metadata
- [ ] Configuration loading integrated into shared library framework
- [ ] Configuration validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for configuration loading achieve 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests show scripts can load and use external configuration
- [ ] Configuration documentation complete with examples
- [ ] All hardcoded values successfully externalized to configuration files

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint S02 (Complete Shared Libraries)
- **Focus:** This enables easy maintenance and customization without code changes
- **Value:** Provides foundation for plugin architecture and easier script management
