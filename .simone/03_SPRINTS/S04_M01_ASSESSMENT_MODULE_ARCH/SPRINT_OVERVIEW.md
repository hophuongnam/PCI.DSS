# Sprint: Assessment Module Architecture (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Establish plugin architecture foundation by creating assessment module structure and extracting 3-4 pilot modules from existing scripts, validating the modular assessment approach.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Assessment Directory Structure** - Create `assessments/` directory with plugin framework
- **Plugin Architecture Framework** - Assessment module loading and execution system
  - Standardized function signatures for assessment modules
  - Module discovery and registration system
  - Integration with shared reporting framework
- **Pilot Assessment Modules** (3-4 modules, ~300 lines each = 900-1200 lines)
  - Extract assessment logic from Requirements 1, 2, 5, 8 (selected for complexity diversity)
  - `assessments/requirement_1_checks.sh` through `assessments/requirement_X_checks.sh`
  - Each module containing requirement-specific assessment functions
- **Module Integration Testing** - Validate modular approach works correctly
- **Plugin Architecture Documentation** - Guide for creating new assessment modules

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] `assessments/` directory structure created with plugin framework
- [ ] Assessment module loading framework implemented in shared libraries
- [ ] 3-4 pilot assessment modules successfully extracted and functional
- [ ] Pilot modules integrate correctly with shared libraries and configuration
- [ ] Assessment module execution matches original script behavior
- [ ] Plugin architecture validated through integration testing
- [ ] Documentation complete for creating new assessment modules
- [ ] Performance testing shows modular approach maintains original speed

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint S03 (Configuration Architecture)
- **Risk:** Assessment logic extraction must maintain exactly the same validation behavior
- **Value:** Validates the plugin architecture approach before full migration
- **Strategy:** Select diverse requirements to test various assessment patterns
