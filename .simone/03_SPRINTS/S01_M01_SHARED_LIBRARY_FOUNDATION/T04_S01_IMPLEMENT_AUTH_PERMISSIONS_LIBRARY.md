# Task: Implement Authentication and Permissions Library

## Description

Implement the authentication and permissions library (`gcp_permissions.sh`) as a core component of the shared library framework. This library will provide unified authentication handling, permission validation, and scope management functions that support both project-level and organization-level PCI DSS assessments across all GCP requirement scripts.

The library establishes the foundation for secure GCP API access by implementing declarative permission requirements, batch validation, coverage reporting, and standardized user interaction patterns for limited access scenarios. This implementation directly supports the framework's goal of eliminating code duplication while maintaining consistent security practices across all assessment scripts.

## Goal / Objectives

- Implement comprehensive authentication and scope handling framework for GCP assessments
- Create unified permission checking system with batch validation capabilities
- Support both project and organization scope assessment patterns
- Establish secure foundation for GCP API access across all requirement scripts
- Provide standardized user interaction for permission limitation scenarios
- Enable permission coverage reporting and audit trail generation

## Technical Guidance

### Required Permission APIs and Scopes

Based on the GCP Refactoring PRD and PCI DSS permission requirements, implement support for:

**Built-in Role Combinations (Recommended):**
- `roles/viewer` - Comprehensive read access to most resources
- `roles/iam.securityReviewer` - IAM and security-specific read access
- `roles/logging.viewer` - Audit log access
- `roles/monitoring.viewer` - Monitoring data access
- `roles/cloudasset.viewer` - Asset inventory across organization
- `roles/accesscontextmanager.policyReader` - VPC Service Controls access

**Permission Categories by PCI DSS Requirement:**
- Network Security Controls (Requirements 1.x): VPC, firewalls, load balancers
- System Configuration (Requirements 2.x): Compute instances, containers, serverless
- Data Protection (Requirements 3.x, 4.x): KMS, storage, databases, certificates
- Malware Protection (Requirements 5.x): Security scanning, container security
- Secure Development (Requirements 6.x): CI/CD, container registries, APIs
- Access Control (Requirements 7.x, 8.x): IAM, organization policies
- Logging and Monitoring (Requirements 10.x): Cloud Logging, monitoring, tracing
- Security Testing (Requirements 11.x): Security Command Center, vulnerability assessment
- Information Security Management (Requirements 12.x): Organizational policies, contacts

### Project vs Organization Scope Handling Patterns

**Project Scope Authentication:**
- Single project assessment with project-level IAM bindings
- Project-specific service account authentication
- Project resource enumeration and validation

**Organization Scope Authentication:**
- Organization-level IAM bindings for comprehensive assessment
- Multi-project resource discovery and aggregation
- Organization policy and constraint validation
- Folder-level permission inheritance handling

### Service Account Authentication Requirements

**Service Account Setup:**
- Automated service account creation and key management
- Secure credential file handling and cleanup
- Service account key rotation and audit trail
- Integration with Cloud Shell and local environments

**Authentication Validation:**
- gcloud authentication status verification
- Service account permission validation
- Project and organization access verification
- API enablement status checking

### Integration Patterns

**Existing Authentication Patterns:**
- Support for both `gcloud auth login` and service account authentication
- Backward compatibility with existing script authentication methods
- Graceful fallback for limited permission scenarios
- Integration with existing error handling and logging patterns

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Core Authentication Framework**
1. Create `gcp_permissions.sh` with basic structure and sourcing patterns
2. Implement authentication detection functions (user vs service account)
3. Add credential validation and environment setup
4. Create scope detection functions (project vs organization)

**Phase 2: Permission Management System**
1. Implement declarative permission registration system
2. Create batch permission validation with parallel processing
3. Add permission coverage calculation and reporting
4. Implement scope-specific permission validation

**Phase 3: User Interaction and Error Handling**
1. Create standardized user prompts for limited access scenarios
2. Implement permission requirement display and guidance
3. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
4. Create audit trail and logging functions

**Phase 4: Testing and Integration**
1. Create automated testing framework for permission validation
2. Test integration with existing authentication patterns
3. Validate across different GCP environments and setups
4. Performance testing for large organization assessments

### Security Considerations

**Credential Security:**
- Never store credentials in logs or temporary files
- Implement secure credential cleanup and rotation
- Use temporary credential files with proper permissions
- Audit all credential access and usage

**Least Privilege Implementation:**
- Follow PCI DSS 4.0.1 Requirement 7.2.1 for least privilege access
- Implement granular permission checking and reporting
- Provide clear justification for each required permission
- Support read-only assessment operations only

**Audit Trail and Logging:**
- Log all authentication attempts and permission checks
- Create comprehensive audit trail for compliance documentation
- Implement tamper-resistant logging mechanisms
- Support export of audit data for external review

**Network Security:**
- Support VPC Service Controls for additional protection
- Implement secure API communication patterns
- Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- Support proxy and firewall configurations

### Compatibility Requirements

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Maintain existing command-line interfaces
- Support existing authentication patterns
- Preserve current error handling behaviors
- Ensure existing scripts continue to function during migration

**Performance Requirements:**
- Permission checking should not increase script execution time by more than 10%
- Batch permission validation for efficiency
- Parallel processing for multi-project assessments
- Caching of permission results where appropriate

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation for partial permissions
- Clear, actionable error messages for permission failures
- Recovery suggestions for common permission issues
- Support for continued assessment with limited permissions
