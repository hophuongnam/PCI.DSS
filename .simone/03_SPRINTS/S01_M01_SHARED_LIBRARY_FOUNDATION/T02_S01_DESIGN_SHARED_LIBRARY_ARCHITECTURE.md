### Function Signature Requirements

Based on the GCP Refactoring PRD, design APIs for the following core functions:

**gcp_common.sh:**
```bash
source_gcp_libraries()           # Load all required libraries
setup_environment()             # Initialize colors, variables, directories  
parse_common_arguments()        # Standard CLI parsing (-s, -p, -o, -h)
validate_prerequisites()        # Check gcloud, permissions, connectivity
print_status()                 # Colored output formatting
load_requirement_config()      # Load requirement-specific configuration
```

**gcp_html_report.sh:**
```bash
initialize_report()            # Template-based report setup
add_section()                 # Dynamic section generation
add_check_result()            # Standardized check formatting
add_summary_metrics()         # Automated summary generation
finalize_report()             # Complete report and open if requested
```

**gcp_permissions.sh:**
```bash
register_required_permissions() # Define needed APIs per requirement
check_all_permissions()        # Batch permission verification
get_permission_coverage()      # Calculate percentage available
prompt_continue_limited()      # Standardized user interaction
validate_scope_permissions()   # Check scope-specific access
```

**gcp_scope_mgmt.sh:**
```bash
setup_assessment_scope()       # Configure project/org scope based on args
get_projects_in_scope()       # Unified project enumeration
build_gcloud_command()        # Dynamic command construction with scope
run_across_projects()         # Execute commands across defined scope
aggregate_cross_project_data() # Combine results from multiple projects
```

### Integration Requirements

- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing command-line interfaces must remain unchanged
- **Migration Strategy:** Support coexistence of old and new architectures during transition
- **Performance:** Script execution time should not increase by more than 10%
- **Error Handling:** 95% of error conditions should be handled gracefully

### Module Separation Principles

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each module should have one clear purpose
2. **Loose Coupling:** Modules should interact through well-defined APIs
3. **High Cohesion:** Related functionality should be grouped together
4. **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not implementations
5. **Configuration-Driven:** Behavior should be configurable without code changes

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Design Approach

1. **Architecture Analysis Phase:**
   - Review current script structure and identify common patterns
   - Map data flow between different functional areas
   - Identify integration points and dependencies
   - Document current API surface and usage patterns

2. **Interface Design Phase:**
   - Define clear contracts for each shared library
   - Specify input/output formats and error conditions
   - Design configuration file formats and validation
   - Create API documentation templates

3. **Integration Design Phase:**
   - Plan migration strategy for each existing script
   - Design compatibility layers and transition mechanisms
   - Create testing strategies for new architecture
   - Plan deployment and rollback procedures

4. **Documentation Phase:**
   - Create comprehensive architectural documentation
   - Develop implementation guidelines for developers
   - Write API reference documentation with examples
   - Document configuration management and customization

### Documentation Requirements

The design document should include:

- **System Architecture Overview:** High-level system design and component relationships
- **Module Specifications:** Detailed specification for each shared library module
- **API Reference:** Complete function signatures, parameters, and return values
- **Configuration Guide:** Format and options for configuration files
- **Integration Patterns:** Common patterns for using shared libraries
- **Migration Guide:** Step-by-step process for migrating existing scripts
- **Testing Strategy:** Approaches for testing shared libraries and integrations
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error codes and handling procedures

### Quality Standards

- **Documentation:** All APIs must have complete documentation with examples
- **Consistency:** All modules must follow the same design patterns
- **Testability:** All interfaces must be designed for easy unit testing
- **Extensibility:** Architecture must support future requirements without major changes
- **Performance:** Design must not introduce significant performance overhead

## Success Metrics

- **Completeness:** All required API interfaces designed and documented
- **Clarity:** Architecture documentation reviewed and approved by stakeholders
- **Feasibility:** Implementation plan validated by development team
- **Alignment:** Design meets all requirements from the GCP Refactoring PRD
- **Quality:** Design document passes technical review process

## Risk Factors

- **Complexity Risk:** Over-engineering the architecture could complicate implementation
- **Compatibility Risk:** Design might not fully support backward compatibility requirements
- **Performance Risk:** Shared library overhead could impact script execution time
- **Adoption Risk:** Complex APIs might hinder developer adoption

## Notes

- Coordinate with T01 findings to ensure all identified patterns are addressed
- Consider future extensibility for additional PCI requirements
- Plan for potential GCP API changes and versioning
- Ensure design supports both project-level and organization-level assessments
- Document decision rationale for future reference

## Deliverables

1. **Architectural Design Document** - Complete system architecture with module specifications
2. **API Reference Documentation** - Detailed function signatures and usage examples  
3. **Integration Guide** - Patterns and examples for using shared libraries
4. **Configuration Specification** - Format and validation rules for config files
5. **Migration Planning Document** - Strategy for transitioning existing scripts
6. **Implementation Guidelines** - Standards and best practices for developers
