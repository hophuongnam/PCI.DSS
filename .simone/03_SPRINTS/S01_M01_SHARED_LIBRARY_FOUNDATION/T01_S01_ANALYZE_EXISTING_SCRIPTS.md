### Analysis Tools and Techniques

#### 1. Manual Code Review
- Read through each script systematically
- Document function signatures and purposes
- Note code patterns and structures
- Identify copy-pasted code blocks

#### 2. Automated Analysis Tools
Use these bash commands for analysis:
```bash
# Line count analysis
wc -l check_gcp_pci_requirement*.sh

# Function extraction
grep -n "^[[:space:]]*[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*[[:space:]]*(" check_gcp_pci_requirement*.sh

# Common pattern identification
grep -n "RED=\|GREEN=\|YELLOW=" check_gcp_pci_requirement*.sh
grep -n "show_help\|parse.*arg" check_gcp_pci_requirement*.sh
grep -n "gcloud\|gsutil" check_gcp_pci_requirement*.sh
```

#### 3. Diff Analysis
```bash
# Compare scripts for similarities
diff check_gcp_pci_requirement1.sh check_gcp_pci_requirement2.sh
```

### Expected Output Format

Create a structured analysis document containing:

#### 1. Executive Summary
- Total lines of code analyzed
- Overall duplication percentage
- Number of common functions identified
- Estimated code reduction potential

#### 2. Detailed Findings by Category
For each analysis area:
- Current implementation patterns
- Code duplication statistics
- Specific functions/blocks for extraction
- Priority level for shared library inclusion

#### 3. Function Extraction Candidates
Table format:
| Function Name | Source Scripts | Line Count | Duplication % | Priority | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------|-------|

#### 4. Dependency Analysis
- Function call relationships
- Dependencies between components
- Extraction order recommendations

#### 5. Code Reduction Projections
- Before/after line count estimates
- Percentage reduction by script
- Overall project impact

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Phase 1: Initial Inventory (1-2 hours)
1. Create a spreadsheet/table documenting each script
2. Count total lines of code per script
3. Document script purposes and main functions
4. Note any obvious patterns at first glance

#### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (3-4 hours)
1. **Authentication Analysis**:
   - Extract all authentication-related code
   - Document gcloud authentication patterns
   - Note service account handling methods
   
2. **CLI Parsing Analysis**:
   - Extract all argument parsing logic
   - Document common options and patterns
   - Note validation and error handling
   
3. **Output Formatting Analysis**:
   - Extract color definitions and formatting
   - Document output patterns
   - Note HTML generation methods

#### Phase 3: Duplication Quantification (2-3 hours)
1. Use diff tools to identify identical code blocks
2. Calculate duplication percentages
3. Document specific line ranges for extraction
4. Measure potential code reduction

#### Phase 4: Function Prioritization (1-2 hours)
1. Rank functions by duplication impact
2. Consider extraction complexity
3. Analyze dependencies between functions
4. Create extraction roadmap

#### Phase 5: Documentation (1-2 hours)
1. Compile findings into comprehensive report
2. Create recommendations for shared library design
3. Document baseline metrics
4. Prepare presentation for stakeholders

### Analysis Templates

#### Function Analysis Template
```
Function: [name]
Source Scripts: [list]
Line Count: [original] â†’ [shared] (reduction: X%)
Dependencies: [list]
Complexity: [low/medium/high]
Priority: [high/medium/low]
Notes: [special considerations]
```

Functions Identified: [count]
Duplication Percentage: [%]
Main Patterns: [list]

```

### Success Metrics
- 68% overall code reduction potential identified
- At least 15-20 common functions documented
- All 8 scripts analyzed with quantified duplication
- Clear roadmap for shared library creation
- Baseline metrics established for progress tracking

### Risks and Considerations
- **Complexity Risk**: Some functions may be more complex to extract than initially apparent
- **Dependency Risk**: Circular dependencies could complicate extraction
- **Testing Risk**: Extracted functions will need comprehensive testing
- **Maintenance Risk**: Shared libraries require ongoing maintenance

### Next Steps After Completion
- Review findings with development team
- Prioritize function extraction order
- Begin shared library architecture design
- Plan incremental refactoring approach
