## Technical Guidance Section

### Required Function Signatures
Based on GCP Refactoring PRD specifications, implement these exact function signatures:

```bash
# Core Library Loading
source_gcp_libraries()           # Load all required libraries

# Environment Management
setup_environment()             # Initialize colors, variables, directories  

# CLI Argument Processing
parse_common_arguments()        # Standard CLI parsing (-s, -p, -o, -h)

# Validation Functions
validate_prerequisites()        # Check gcloud, permissions, connectivity

# Output and Logging
print_status()                 # Colored output formatting

# Configuration Management
load_requirement_config()      # Load requirement-specific configuration
```

### Color-Coding Standards
Implement consistent terminal output color scheme:
- **Red:** Error messages and failed checks
- **Green:** Success messages and passed checks
- **Yellow:** Warning messages and partial compliance
- **Blue:** Informational messages and headers
- **Cyan:** Command examples and code snippets
- **White/Default:** Regular text and descriptions

### CLI Argument Patterns
Support standardized command-line options across all scripts:
- `-s, --scope`: Assessment scope (project|organization)
- `-p, --project`: Target project ID or organization ID
- `-o, --output`: Output directory for reports
- `-h, --help`: Display help information and usage examples

### Integration Points with Existing Scripts
- Functions must be compatible with existing gcloud SDK commands
- Maintain backward compatibility with current script interfaces
- Support both interactive and non-interactive execution modes
- Handle existing environment variable patterns

### Error Handling Patterns
Follow consistent error handling approach:
- Use standardized exit codes (0=success, 1=error, 2=warning)
- Provide actionable error messages with remediation suggestions
- Log errors to both console and log files
- Support graceful degradation when optional features fail

## Implementation Notes Section

### Detailed Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Directory Structure Setup
Create organized library structure:
```
GCP/
├── lib/
│   ├── gcp_common.sh           # Core common library (this task)
│   ├── gcp_html_report.sh      # HTML report engine (future task)
│   ├── gcp_permissions.sh      # Permission management (future task)
│   └── gcp_scope_mgmt.sh       # Scope management (future task)
├── config/                     # Configuration files (future)
└── assessments/                # Assessment modules (future)
```

#### Phase 2: Core Function Implementation
Implement functions in this order to maintain dependencies:
1. `source_gcp_libraries()` - Library loading mechanism
2. `setup_environment()` - Color variables and environment initialization
3. `print_status()` - Basic logging and output functions
4. `validate_prerequisites()` - System and tool validation
5. `parse_common_arguments()` - CLI argument processing
6. `load_requirement_config()` - Configuration file support

#### Phase 3: Testing Strategy
- Create `test_gcp_common.sh` script to validate each function
- Test library loading and function availability
- Validate CLI argument parsing with various input combinations
- Test error handling scenarios and edge cases
- Verify color output works across different terminal types

### Technical Implementation Details

**source_gcp_libraries():**
- Determine library directory path relative to calling script
- Load gcp_common.sh and validate successful loading
- Set global variables for library paths and availability
- Handle missing library files gracefully

**setup_environment():**
- Define color variables (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN, NC)
- Set default directories for logs, reports, and temporary files
- Initialize global variables for script execution
- Create required directories if they don't exist

**parse_common_arguments():**
- Process command-line arguments using getopts or manual parsing
- Support both short (-s) and long (--scope) option formats
- Validate argument values and set global variables
- Display help information when requested

**validate_prerequisites():**
- Check for required tools: gcloud, jq, curl
- Validate gcloud authentication status
- Test basic GCP API connectivity
- Verify minimum required permissions for assessment

**print_status():**

[2025-06-05 14:17]: ST-9 completed - Integration test script test_gcp_common.sh created with 30 comprehensive test cases
[2025-06-05 14:17]: ST-10-11 completed - All functions documented with signatures and validated through testing
[2025-06-05 14:17]: Integration testing completed - ALL 30 TESTS PASSED successfully
[2025-06-05 14:17]: Task work execution completed - Core common library fully implemented and validated
[2025-06-05 14:17]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** Implementation deviates from architectural specifications requiring interface corrections.
**Scope:** Task T03_S01_IMPLEMENT_CORE_COMMON_LIBRARY code review and architectural compliance validation.
**Findings:** 
- Severity 8/10: CLI argument parsing interface mismatch (-o for output vs architecture expectation)
- Severity 7/10: Print status function uses different status values (info/success/warning/error vs PASS/FAIL/WARN/INFO)  
- Severity 6/10: Function naming deviation (display_help vs show_help in architecture calls)
- Severity 6/10: Missing architectural variables (SCOPE_TYPE, ORG_ID, REPORT_ONLY, assessment counters)
- Severity 5/10: Directory structure deviation (TEMP_DIR vs WORK_DIR pattern)
- Severity 3/10: Scope creep with additional utility functions beyond specifications
**Summary:** While functionally complete and well-tested (30/30 tests passing), the implementation includes interface deviations that would break integration with the broader shared library framework. Core functionality is solid but architectural compliance requires corrections.
**Recommendation:** Address interface mismatches to align with PRD specifications before proceeding to T04_S01. The 434-line implementation is high quality but needs architectural alignment.
