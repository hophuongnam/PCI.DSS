### Function Signature Requirements

Based on the GCP Refactoring PRD, design APIs for the following core functions:

**gcp_common.sh:**
```bash
source_gcp_libraries()           # Load all required libraries
setup_environment()             # Initialize colors, variables, directories  
parse_common_arguments()        # Standard CLI parsing (-s, -p, -o, -h)
validate_prerequisites()        # Check gcloud, permissions, connectivity
print_status()                 # Colored output formatting
load_requirement_config()      # Load requirement-specific configuration
```

**gcp_html_report.sh:**
```bash
initialize_report()            # Template-based report setup
add_section()                 # Dynamic section generation
add_check_result()            # Standardized check formatting
add_summary_metrics()         # Automated summary generation
finalize_report()             # Complete report and open if requested
```

**gcp_permissions.sh:**
```bash
register_required_permissions() # Define needed APIs per requirement
check_all_permissions()        # Batch permission verification
get_permission_coverage()      # Calculate percentage available
prompt_continue_limited()      # Standardized user interaction
validate_scope_permissions()   # Check scope-specific access
```

**gcp_scope_mgmt.sh:**
```bash
setup_assessment_scope()       # Configure project/org scope based on args
get_projects_in_scope()       # Unified project enumeration
build_gcloud_command()        # Dynamic command construction with scope
run_across_projects()         # Execute commands across defined scope
aggregate_cross_project_data() # Combine results from multiple projects
```

### Integration Requirements

- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing command-line interfaces must remain unchanged
- **Migration Strategy:** Support coexistence of old and new architectures during transition
- **Performance:** Script execution time should not increase by more than 10%
- **Error Handling:** 95% of error conditions should be handled gracefully

### Module Separation Principles

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each module should have one clear purpose
2. **Loose Coupling:** Modules should interact through well-defined APIs
3. **High Cohesion:** Related functionality should be grouped together
4. **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not implementations
5. **Configuration-Driven:** Behavior should be configurable without code changes

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Design Approach

1. **Architecture Analysis Phase:**
   - Review current script structure and identify common patterns
   - Map data flow between different functional areas
   - Identify integration points and dependencies
   - Document current API surface and usage patterns

2. **Interface Design Phase:**
   - Define clear contracts for each shared library
   - Specify input/output formats and error conditions
   - Design configuration file formats and validation
   - Create API documentation templates

3. **Integration Design Phase:**
   - Plan migration strategy for each existing script
   - Design compatibility layers and transition mechanisms
   - Create testing strategies for new architecture
   - Plan deployment and rollback procedures

4. **Documentation Phase:**
   - Create comprehensive architectural documentation
   - Develop implementation guidelines for developers
   - Write API reference documentation with examples
   - Document configuration management and customization

### Documentation Requirements

The design document should include:

- **System Architecture Overview:** High-level system design and component relationships
- **Module Specifications:** Detailed specification for each shared library module
- **API Reference:** Complete function signatures, parameters, and return values
- **Configuration Guide:** Format and options for configuration files
- **Integration Patterns:** Common patterns for using shared libraries
- **Migration Guide:** Step-by-step process for migrating existing scripts
- **Testing Strategy:** Approaches for testing shared libraries and integrations
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error codes and handling procedures

### Quality Standards

- **Documentation:** All APIs must have complete documentation with examples
- **Consistency:** All modules must follow the same design patterns
- **Testability:** All interfaces must be designed for easy unit testing
- **Extensibility:** Architecture must support future requirements without major changes
- **Performance:** Design must not introduce significant performance overhead

## Success Metrics

- **Completeness:** All required API interfaces designed and documented
- **Clarity:** Architecture documentation reviewed and approved by stakeholders
- **Feasibility:** Implementation plan validated by development team
- **Alignment:** Design meets all requirements from the GCP Refactoring PRD
- **Quality:** Design document passes technical review process

## Risk Factors

- **Complexity Risk:** Over-engineering the architecture could complicate implementation
- **Compatibility Risk:** Design might not fully support backward compatibility requirements
- **Performance Risk:** Shared library overhead could impact script execution time
- **Adoption Risk:** Complex APIs might hinder developer adoption

## Notes

- Coordinate with T01 findings to ensure all identified patterns are addressed
- Consider future extensibility for additional PCI requirements
- Plan for potential GCP API changes and versioning
- Ensure design supports both project-level and organization-level assessments
- Document decision rationale for future reference

## Deliverables

1. **Architectural Design Document** - Complete system architecture with module specifications
2. **API Reference Documentation** - Detailed function signatures and usage examples  
3. **Integration Guide** - Patterns and examples for using shared libraries
4. **Configuration Specification** - Format and validation rules for config files
5. **Migration Planning Document** - Strategy for transitioning existing scripts
6. **Implementation Guidelines** - Standards and best practices for developers

Result: **FAIL** Critical gaps and incomplete deliverables prevent implementation.
**Scope:** Task T02_S01_DESIGN_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE architecture design and deliverables review.
**Findings:** 
- Severity 9/10: Sections 4-6 contain placeholder text instead of implementation details
- Severity 9/10: Configuration framework design missing despite being core requirement

**Summary:** While 1,208-line architecture document shows substantial effort with 26 API functions designed, critical gaps exist in configuration framework, migration strategy, integration patterns, and implementation guidelines. Multiple sections contain placeholder text preventing actual implementation.
