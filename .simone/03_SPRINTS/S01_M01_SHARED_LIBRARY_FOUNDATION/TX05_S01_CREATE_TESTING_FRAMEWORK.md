## Technical Guidance

### Testing Framework Requirements

#### 1. Bats-Core Framework Setup
Primary testing framework for shell script testing:
```bash
# Installation options
# Via package manager (recommended)
brew install bats-core bats-file bats-assert

# Or manual installation
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
cd bats-core
./install.sh /usr/local
```

#### 2. Testing Framework Structure
Organize tests in logical directory structure:
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── test_authentication.bats
│   │   ├── test_cli_parsing.bats
│   │   ├── test_output_formatting.bats
│   │   └── test_html_generation.bats
│   └── permissions/
│       ├── test_permission_checking.bats
│       ├── test_role_validation.bats
│       └── test_scope_handling.bats
├── integration/
│   ├── test_library_combinations.bats
│   ├── test_end_to_end_flows.bats
│   └── test_cross_library_dependencies.bats
├── validation/
│   ├── test_requirement1_compatibility.bats
│   ├── test_requirement2_compatibility.bats
│   └── [... for all 8 requirements]
├── mocks/
│   ├── mock_gcloud_responses/
│   ├── mock_data_sets/
│   └── test_environments/
└── helpers/
    ├── test_helpers.bash
    ├── mock_helpers.bash
    └── coverage_helpers.bash
```

#### 3. Test Coverage Tools and Targets
Use `kcov` or `bashcov` for code coverage measurement:
```bash
# Install kcov for bash coverage
# macOS
brew install kcov

# Usage example
kcov --include-path=/path/to/shared/libraries coverage-output test-command
```

**Coverage Targets:**
- Unit Tests: 95% function coverage, 90% line coverage
- Integration Tests: 85% interaction coverage
- Validation Tests: 100% existing script behavior coverage
- Overall Target: 90% combined coverage

#### 4. Mock and Test Data Requirements

##### GCP Service Mocking
Mock GCP CLI responses and API calls:
```bash
# Mock gcloud command responses
mock_gcloud_response() {
  local command="$1"
  local response_file="$2"
  
  case "$command" in
    "projects list")
      cat "$MOCK_DIR/projects_list.json"
      ;;
    "iam roles list")
      cat "$MOCK_DIR/iam_roles.json"
      ;;
  esac
}
```

##### Test Data Sets
- Sample project configurations
- Mock IAM policies and roles
- Simulated resource inventories
- Expected output samples
- Error condition scenarios

### Testing Strategy and Implementation

#### 1. Unit Testing Strategy

##### Function-Level Testing
Each shared library function requires comprehensive testing:
```bash
# Example unit test structure
@test "authenticate_service_account: validates service account key file" {
  # Setup
  setup_mock_service_account_key
  
  # Execute
  run authenticate_service_account "$TEST_KEY_FILE"
  
  # Assert
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [[ "$output" =~ "Authentication successful" ]]
}

@test "authenticate_service_account: handles missing key file" {
  # Execute
  run authenticate_service_account "/nonexistent/key.json"
  
  # Assert
  [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
  [[ "$output" =~ "Key file not found" ]]
}
```

##### Input Validation Testing
Test boundary conditions and error handling:
- Valid inputs with expected outputs
- Invalid inputs with proper error handling
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Empty, null, and malformed inputs

##### State Management Testing
Test function interactions and state changes:
- Global variable modifications
- Environment variable handling
- File system interactions
- Configuration state management

#### 2. Integration Testing Strategy

##### Library Combination Testing
Test interactions between shared libraries:
```bash
@test "gcp_common + gcp_permissions: full authentication flow" {
  # Setup
  source ../shared/gcp_common.sh
  source ../shared/gcp_permissions.sh
  
  # Execute full flow
  run integrated_auth_and_permission_check "$PROJECT_ID" "$REQUIRED_PERMISSION"
  
  # Assert
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  verify_authentication_state
  verify_permission_validation
}
```

##### End-to-End Flow Testing
Test complete workflows using shared libraries:
- Authentication → Scope Setting → Permission Check → Resource Query
- CLI Parsing → Validation → Execution → Report Generation
- Error Handling → Recovery → Retry Logic

#### 3. Validation Testing Strategy

##### Behavioral Compatibility Testing
Ensure shared libraries produce identical outputs to original scripts:
```bash
@test "requirement1 shared library matches original script output" {
  # Setup identical test conditions
  setup_test_project
  
  # Run original script
  run bash check_gcp_pci_requirement1.sh --project "$TEST_PROJECT"
  original_output="$output"
  original_status="$status"
  
  # Run with shared libraries
  run bash requirement1_with_shared_libs.sh --project "$TEST_PROJECT"
  shared_output="$output"
  shared_status="$status"
  
  # Compare results
  [ "$original_status" -eq "$shared_status" ]
  compare_outputs "$original_output" "$shared_output"
}
```

##### Regression Testing
Prevent functionality regression during refactoring:
- Baseline behavior capture
- Output format consistency
- Error message compatibility
- Exit code standardization

#### 4. Performance Benchmarking

##### Execution Time Comparison
Measure performance impact of shared libraries:
```bash
benchmark_execution_time() {
  local script="$1"
  local iterations="${2:-10}"
  
  total_time=0
  for ((i=1; i<=iterations; i++)); do
    start_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    bash "$script" >/dev/null 2>&1
    end_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    duration=$(echo "$end_time - $start_time" | bc)
    total_time=$(echo "$total_time + $duration" | bc)
  done
  
  average_time=$(echo "scale=3; $total_time / $iterations" | bc)
  echo "$average_time"
}
```

##### Memory Usage Analysis
Monitor memory consumption:
- Baseline memory usage of original scripts
- Memory usage with shared libraries
- Memory leak detection
- Resource cleanup validation

### Test Automation and Reporting

#### 1. Automated Test Execution
Create comprehensive test runner:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_runner.sh

# Configuration
TEST_DIR="tests"
COVERAGE_DIR="coverage"
REPORT_DIR="reports"

# Test execution functions
run_unit_tests() {
  echo "Running unit tests..."
  bats "$TEST_DIR/unit"/*.bats
}

run_integration_tests() {
  echo "Running integration tests..."
  bats "$TEST_DIR/integration"/*.bats
}

run_validation_tests() {
  echo "Running validation tests..."
  bats "$TEST_DIR/validation"/*.bats
}

generate_coverage_report() {
  echo "Generating coverage report..."
  kcov --include-path=../shared "$COVERAGE_DIR" "$TEST_DIR"/**/*.bats
}

# Main execution
main() {
  setup_test_environment
  run_unit_tests
  run_integration_tests
  run_validation_tests
  generate_coverage_report
  generate_html_report
  cleanup_test_environment
}
```

#### 2. Test Reporting
Generate comprehensive test reports:
- Test execution summary
- Coverage analysis
- Performance benchmarks
- Failure analysis
- Trend tracking

#### 3. CI/CD Integration Preparation
Prepare for continuous integration:
- Test configuration files for CI platforms
- Automated test triggers
- Failure notification systems
- Quality gates based on coverage thresholds

### Mock Environments and Test Data

#### 1. GCP Environment Simulation
Create realistic test environments:
```bash
# Mock GCP environment setup
setup_mock_gcp_environment() {
  export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT="test-project-12345"
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$TEST_DIR/mocks/test-service-account.json"
  
  # Create mock service account key
  create_mock_service_account_key
  
  # Setup mock gcloud responses
  setup_gcloud_command_mocks
}
```

#### 2. Test Data Management
Organize and manage test data:
- Project configurations
- IAM policies and bindings
- Resource inventories
- Expected output samples
- Error scenarios

### Quality Assurance and Maintenance

#### 1. Test Quality Standards
Establish testing standards:
- Test naming conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Code review process for tests
- Test maintenance procedures

#### 2. Continuous Improvement
Implement test improvement processes:
- Regular test review cycles
- Coverage gap analysis
- Performance optimization
- Test maintainability enhancement
