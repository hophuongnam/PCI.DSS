## Technical Guidance

### Integration Testing Requirements

#### 1. Shared Library Loading Validation
Test the complete shared library loading process:
```bash
# Test library loading order and dependencies
source lib/gcp_common.sh
source lib/gcp_permissions.sh
source lib/gcp_html_report.sh
source lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh

# Verify all functions are available
declare -F | grep -E "(setup_environment|check_all_permissions|initialize_report|setup_assessment_scope)"
```

#### 2. Integration Test Framework
Create systematic integration tests:
```bash
# Integration test template
test_integration() {
    local test_name="$1"
    local expected_result="$2"
    
    echo "Running integration test: $test_name"
    # Test implementation
    # Result validation
    # Pass/fail reporting
}
```

#### 3. Performance Measurement Tools
Use these commands for performance benchmarking:
```bash
# Execution time measurement
time ./check_gcp_pci_requirement1.sh --help

# Memory usage analysis
/usr/bin/time -l ./check_gcp_pci_requirement1.sh --project test-project

# Function call profiling
bash -x ./check_gcp_pci_requirement1.sh --help 2>&1 | grep "^+" | wc -l
```

### Validation Criteria

#   $2 - [parameter description]
# Returns:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - [error condition]
# Example:
#   function_name "value1" "value2"
```
