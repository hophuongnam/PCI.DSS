# Sprint S01: Shared Library Foundation

## Sprint Goal
Create the foundational shared library framework that will eliminate code duplication across GCP PCI DSS requirement scripts.

## Sprint Scope
**Focus:** Build core shared libraries for common functionality found across all requirement scripts.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Core Shared Library (`gcp_pci_shared_lib.sh`)
- [ ] Authentication and project/org scope handling
- [ ] Color-coded terminal output functions
- [ ] Common CLI argument parsing framework
- [ ] Standard logging and reporting functions
- [ ] Error handling and validation utilities

### 2. Analysis & Planning
- [ ] Complete code analysis of all 8 existing scripts
- [ ] Identify common patterns and functions
- [ ] Design shared library API interface
- [ ] Create refactoring strategy document

### 3. Foundation Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for shared library functions
- [ ] Integration test framework setup
- [ ] Validation against existing script behavior

## Sprint Backlog Tasks

### T06: Integration Validation
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 0.5 days (6-8 hours)  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Description:** Perform final integration validation and complete Sprint S01 documentation.  
**Task File:** [T06_S01_INTEGRATION_VALIDATION.md](T06_S01_INTEGRATION_VALIDATION.md)

## Definition of Done
