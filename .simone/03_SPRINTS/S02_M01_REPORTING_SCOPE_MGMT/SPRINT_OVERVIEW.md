# Sprint: Reporting & Scope Management Libraries (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Complete the shared library framework by implementing HTML reporting and scope management libraries, providing full shared infrastructure for all GCP PCI DSS scripts.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **`lib/gcp_html_report.sh`** (300 lines) - Centralized HTML report generation engine
  - initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
  - Consistent styling and responsive design templates
  - Integration with existing report formats
- **`lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`** (150 lines) - Project/organization scope handling
  - setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope(), build_gcloud_command()
  - Unified scope management across all requirements
  - Cross-project data aggregation support
- **Complete Library Testing** - Unit tests for all shared library functions
- **Library Documentation** - API documentation and usage examples
- **Integration Validation** - Test shared libraries with existing scripts

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] `lib/gcp_html_report.sh` implemented with all core functions
- [ ] `lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh` implemented with scope handling capabilities
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 90%+ coverage for new library functions
- [ ] Integration tests pass with existing GCP scripts
- [ ] Library API documentation complete
- [ ] Performance validation shows <5% overhead vs current implementation
- [ ] All shared libraries working together as cohesive framework

## Sprint Tasks
1. **T01_S02** - HTML Report Engine Implementation (Medium)
2. **T02_S02** - Scope Management Engine Implementation (Medium)
3. **T03_S02** - Integration Testing & Performance Validation (Medium)
4. **T04_S02** - Documentation & API Completion (Low)
5. **T05_S02** - Pilot Script Migration (High)
6. **T06_S02** - Complete Framework Validation (Medium)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Sprint S01 (Core Shared Libraries)
- **Risk:** HTML report generation must maintain backward compatibility with existing output
- **Value:** Provides complete shared library foundation enabling all subsequent development
