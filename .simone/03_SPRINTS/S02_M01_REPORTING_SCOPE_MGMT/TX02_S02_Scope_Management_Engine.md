# Task: Scope Management Engine Implementation

## Description
Implement a unified scope management library that provides standardized handling of assessment scope across all GCP PCI DSS requirement scripts. This engine will consolidate the currently duplicated scope management patterns found in individual requirement scripts and provide consistent project enumeration, command execution, and cross-project data aggregation capabilities.

The scope management engine addresses the current inconsistencies where each requirement script implements its own scope logic, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistencies in how organization vs project scope assessments are performed.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a comprehensive scope management library that:
- Provides unified scope management across all GCP PCI DSS assessment scripts
- Standardizes project enumeration and validation patterns
- Implements consistent gcloud command construction for different scopes
- Enables efficient cross-project data aggregation and processing
- Integrates seamlessly with existing `gcp_common.sh` CLI parsing and error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `gcp_scope.sh` library created with all 5 required functions implemented
- [ ] `setup_assessment_scope()` function validates and configures scope (project/organization)
- [ ] `get_projects_in_scope()` function returns appropriate project list based on scope
- [ ] `build_gcloud_command()` function constructs scope-aware gcloud commands
- [ ] `run_across_projects()` function executes commands across project scope efficiently
- [ ] `aggregate_cross_project_data()` function handles cross-project result consolidation
- [ ] Library integrates with existing `gcp_common.sh` CLI parsing and validation
- [ ] Error handling for insufficient permissions and API access failures
- [ ] Support for both organization-wide and single project assessments
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples and integration patterns
- [ ] Library file size approximately 150 lines with focused, efficient implementation

## Subtasks
- [x] Analyze existing scope management patterns across requirement scripts
- [x] Design function interfaces based on `gcp_common.sh` architecture patterns
- [x] Implement `setup_assessment_scope()` with scope validation and configuration
- [x] Implement `get_projects_in_scope()` with project enumeration logic

- [x] Implement `aggregate_cross_project_data()` with data consolidation logic
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and permission validation
- [x] Create integration tests for both organization and project scope scenarios
- [x] Add usage documentation and function reference
- [x] Validate integration with existing requirement scripts
- [x] Fix critical filename deviation: rename gcp_scope.sh to gcp_scope_mgmt.sh per PRD specification
- [x] Update all references and imports to use correct filename

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points

Based on analysis of existing GCP requirement scripts, the scope management engine should integrate with these key patterns:

**CLI Integration with gcp_common.sh:**
```bash
# Leverage existing CLI parsing from gcp_common.sh
parse_common_arguments "$@"
# Uses: SCOPE, SCOPE_TYPE, PROJECT_ID, ORG_ID variables
```

**Current Scope Management Patterns Found:**
- Each script manually handles `ASSESSMENT_SCOPE` variable (project/organization)
- Duplicate project enumeration: `gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id:$DEFAULT_ORG"`
- Inconsistent command construction patterns across scripts
- Manual cross-project iteration with varying error handling approaches
- Variable naming inconsistencies: `DEFAULT_PROJECT` vs `PROJECT_ID`, `DEFAULT_ORG` vs `ORG_ID`
- Duplicated CLI parsing logic for scope parameters in each script
- Inconsistent permission validation patterns across different requirements

**Required Function Signatures:**

1. **setup_assessment_scope()**
   ```bash
   # Configure and validate assessment scope
   # Input: Uses global variables from parse_common_arguments
   # Output: Sets ASSESSMENT_SCOPE, validates permissions
   # Return: 0 on success, 1 on validation failure
   ```

2. **get_projects_in_scope()**
   ```bash
   # Return list of projects based on scope configuration
   # Input: None (uses global scope variables)
   # Output: Project IDs (one per line)
   # Return: 0 on success, 1 on enumeration failure
   ```

3. **build_gcloud_command(base_command, [project_override])**
   ```bash
   # Construct scope-aware gcloud command
   # Input: base command string, optional project override
   # Output: Complete gcloud command with appropriate --project flag
   # Return: Constructed command string
   ```

4. **run_across_projects(base_command, [format_option])**
   ```bash
   # Execute command across all projects in scope
   # Input: base gcloud command, optional format parameter
   # Output: Aggregated results with project prefixes for org scope
   # Return: 0 on success, 1 on execution failure
   ```

5. **aggregate_cross_project_data(raw_data, [delimiter])**
   ```bash
   # Process and format cross-project results
   # Input: Raw command output, optional delimiter
   # Output: Formatted results with project context
   # Return: Processed data suitable for analysis
   ```

### Organization vs Project Scope Patterns

**Organization Scope Handling:**
- Project enumeration: `gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id:$ORG_ID" --format="value(projectId)"`
- Command execution: Add `--project=$PROJECT` to each command
- Result prefixing: Format as `$PROJECT/$RESOURCE_NAME` for clarity
- Permission validation: Check both org-level and project-level permissions

**Project Scope Handling:**
- Single project validation: `gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID`
- Command execution: Add `--project=$PROJECT_ID` to commands
- Result processing: Direct output without project prefixes
- Permission validation: Check project-specific API access

### Error Handling and Permission Patterns

Based on existing scripts, implement these error handling patterns:
- API access validation before main execution
- Graceful degradation when permissions are insufficient
- Detailed error messages with suggested remediation
- Permission percentage calculation for assessment completeness

**Permission Validation Pattern:**
```bash
# From check_gcp_permission function in existing scripts
check_gcp_permission "Service" "operation" "test_command"
# Track access_denied_checks counter
# Calculate permissions_percentage for completeness assessment
```

### Cross-Project Data Aggregation Approaches

**Current Patterns in Existing Scripts:**
1. **Simple Aggregation:** Concatenate results with project prefixes
2. **Counted Aggregation:** Sum counts across projects for metrics
3. **Filtered Aggregation:** Apply filters during or after aggregation
4. **Structured Aggregation:** Maintain project context in structured output

**Implementation Examples from Existing Code:**
```bash
# Pattern from requirement2 script run_across_projects function:
for project in $projects; do
    local cmd=$(build_gcloud_command "$base_command" "$project")
    local project_results=$(eval "$cmd" 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$project_results" ]; then
        while IFS= read -r line; do
            if [ -n "$line" ]; then
                results="${results}${project}/${line}"$'\n'
            fi
        done <<< "$project_results"
    fi
done

# Pattern from requirement1 script get_all_networks function:
if [ "$ASSESSMENT_SCOPE" == "organization" ]; then
    PROJECTS=$(gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id:$DEFAULT_ORG" --format="value(projectId)" 2>/dev/null)
    for project in $PROJECTS; do
        project_networks=$(gcloud compute networks list --project="$project" --format="value(name)" 2>/dev/null)
        while IFS= read -r network; do
            if [ -n "$network" ]; then
                NETWORK_LIST="${NETWORK_LIST}${project}/${network}"$'\n'
            fi
        done <<< "$project_networks"
    done
fi

# Current scope validation pattern across scripts:
if [ "$ASSESSMENT_SCOPE" == "organization" ]; then
    if [ -z "$DEFAULT_ORG" ]; then
        print_status $RED "Error: Organization scope requires an organization ID."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### Current Code Duplication Analysis

**Duplicated Functions Found Across Scripts:**
- `build_gcloud_command()` - Present in requirement1_integrated.sh, requirement2.sh (60+ lines total)
- `run_across_projects()` - Multiple implementations with slight variations (80+ lines total)
- `get_projects_in_scope()` - Simple versions scattered across scripts (30+ lines total)
- CLI parsing for `-s|--scope`, `-p|--project`, `-o|--org` flags (120+ lines total)
- Scope validation logic and error handling (40+ lines total)

**Total Estimated Duplication:** ~330+ lines of scope management code that could be consolidated into a single 150-line library, representing a 55% reduction in codebase size for scope management.

### Integration with Existing gcp_common.sh Architecture

The scope management engine should:
- Use `print_status` function for consistent logging
- Leverage `validate_prerequisites` for permission checking
- Integrate with `setup_environment` for directory initialization
- Follow existing variable naming conventions (SCOPE_TYPE, PROJECT_ID, ORG_ID)
- Use global counters (total_projects, passed_checks, etc.)
- Bridge the gap between old patterns (DEFAULT_PROJECT, DEFAULT_ORG) and new patterns (PROJECT_ID, ORG_ID)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Scenarios:**
- Organization scope with multiple projects
- Single project scope validation
- Permission failure handling
- API access error scenarios
- Cross-project data aggregation accuracy

**Integration Testing with Existing Scripts:**
- Verify backward compatibility with requirement scripts
- Test scope switching between organization and project modes
- Validate error handling consistency
- Confirm performance with large project sets

## Implementation Notes

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement parallel execution for cross-project commands where possible
- Cache project list to avoid repeated API calls
- Use efficient string processing for large result sets
- Implement timeout handling for slow API responses

**Scope Management State:**
- Maintain scope configuration in global variables consistent with gcp_common.sh
- Provide scope validation before expensive operations
- Enable scope switching within single script execution if needed

**Data Format Consistency:**
- Standardize project prefix format: `$PROJECT_ID/$RESOURCE_NAME`
- Maintain consistent field separators across different data types
- Preserve original gcloud output formats while adding project context
- Support both line-oriented and structured (JSON) output formats

**Library Size Target:** Approximately 150 lines focusing on:
- Core scope management logic (60 lines)
- Cross-project execution engine (40 lines)
- Error handling and validation (30 lines)
- Integration helpers and utilities (20 lines)
