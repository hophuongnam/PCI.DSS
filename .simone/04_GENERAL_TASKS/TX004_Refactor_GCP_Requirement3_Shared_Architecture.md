# Task: Refactor GCP Check for Requirement 3 to Follow Shared Architecture

## Description
The GCP Requirement 3 script needs to be refactored to fully comply with the shared library architecture framework. While the script was previously migrated as part of the TX05_S02 pilot migration, analysis reveals several critical issues with framework compliance, API consistency, and code organization. The current script contains 557 lines but should be reduced to ~50 lines of orchestration code with proper shared library integration. Multiple versions exist (current, migrated, broken, original) indicating unresolved integration issues that need to be addressed.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve full compliance with the 4-library shared architecture framework
- Reduce script size from 557 lines to target ~50 lines (71.6% reduction)
- Standardize all library API usage to match framework specifications
- Extract assessment logic to modular, reusable functions
- Ensure 100% test coverage with the existing BATS testing framework
- Resolve multiple script version conflicts and establish single canonical version

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script uses all 4 shared libraries (gcp_common.sh, gcp_html_report.sh, gcp_permissions.sh, gcp_scope_mgmt.sh) with correct API signatures
- [ ] Script follows standardized initialization pattern: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- [ ] Permission management uses register_required_permissions() and check_required_permissions() framework functions
- [ ] HTML report generation uses correct API: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
- [ ] Scope management properly uses setup_assessment_scope() and get_projects_in_scope()
- [ ] Assessment logic is extracted to separate modular functions
- [ ] Script passes all existing BATS unit and integration tests
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold requirement
- [ ] PCI DSS Requirement 3 sub-sections (3.2-3.7) maintain full coverage
- [ ] Multiple script versions are consolidated to single canonical implementation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze current script issues and document specific API mismatches
- [ ] Standardize library loading and environment setup to framework pattern
- [ ] Fix HTML report API usage to match framework specifications
- [ ] Implement proper permission management using framework functions
- [ ] Integrate scope management library for project iteration
- [ ] Extract assessment logic to modular functions (assess_storage_encryption, assess_database_encryption, etc.)
- [ ] Update error handling and logging to use framework patterns
- [ ] Consolidate multiple script versions to single canonical implementation
- [ ] Update/create comprehensive unit tests for refactored functions
- [ ] Validate integration tests pass with refactored implementation
- [ ] Update documentation and ensure compliance with architecture standards

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Main Script**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement3.sh` - Current implementation needing refactoring
- **Migrated Version**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/migrated/check_gcp_pci_requirement3_migrated.sh` - Closer to target but has API inconsistencies
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - Four library framework providing standardized functions
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/` - BATS testing framework for validation

### Framework API Standards
Reference the shared library implementations for correct function signatures:
- `gcp_common.sh`: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- `gcp_permissions.sh`: register_required_permissions(), check_required_permissions()
- `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`: setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope()
- `gcp_html_report.sh`: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()

### Required Permissions for Requirement 3
```bash
REQ3_PERMISSIONS=(
    "cloudsql.instances.list"
    "storage.buckets.getIamPolicy" 
    "cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list"
    "compute.disks.list"
)
```

### PCI DSS Coverage Requirements
Maintain assessment coverage for:
- 3.2.1: Data retention and disposal policies
- 3.3.1: Sensitive authentication data controls
- 3.5.1: PAN protection mechanisms
- 3.6.1: Cryptographic key protection
- 3.7.1-3.7.8: Key management lifecycle

### Testing Approach
Follow established BATS testing patterns in `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/`:
- Syntax and structure validation
- 4-library framework integration tests
- PCI DSS sub-requirement coverage validation
- Permission registration and validation tests
- HTML report generation validation
- Error handling and performance tests

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
This task aligns with:
- **Sprint S02**: Current focus on reporting and scope management framework completion
- **Architecture Design**: 4-library shared framework with 68% code reduction target
- **Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, 100% CLI compatibility, performance <10% regression

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Audit Phase**: Document all current API mismatches and framework violations
2. **Standardization Phase**: Update all library integrations to use correct framework APIs  
3. **Modularization Phase**: Extract assessment logic to separate reusable functions
4. **Consolidation Phase**: Merge multiple script versions into single canonical implementation
5. **Validation Phase**: Ensure all tests pass and coverage requirements met

### Key Files to Modify
- Primary script requiring complete refactoring to framework compliance
- Test files in unit/requirements/ may need updates for new function signatures
- Integration tests should validate end-to-end workflow with shared libraries

### Performance Considerations
Target execution time must remain consistent with current performance while achieving significant code reduction through proper library utilization and efficient resource discovery patterns.
