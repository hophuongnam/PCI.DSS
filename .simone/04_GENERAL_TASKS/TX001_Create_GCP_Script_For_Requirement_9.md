# Task: Create GCP Script For Requirement 9

## Description
Create a comprehensive GCP PCI DSS Requirement 9 assessment script to evaluate physical access controls and their cloud equivalents. This task implements the next logical sequence in the GCP PCI DSS assessment suite following the successful completion of Requirements 1-8. The script must integrate with the established 4-library framework and provide automated assessment of cloud-native physical security controls while maintaining architectural compliance standards.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement check_gcp_pci_requirement9.sh following the migrated framework pattern
- Assess GCP cloud equivalents of physical access controls (KMS, Storage, IAM, Asset Inventory)
- Generate professional HTML reports consistent with existing requirement scripts
- Ensure full integration with the 4-library shared framework (gcp_common.sh, gcp_permissions.sh, gcp_html_report.sh, gcp_scope_mgmt.sh)
- Provide comprehensive testing coverage matching established patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Script created at `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement9.sh`
- [x] Full integration with all 4 shared libraries using migrated framework pattern
- [x] Assessment coverage for PCI DSS v4.0.1 Requirement 9 sub-requirements (9.1-9.5)
- [x] Cloud-native security controls mapped: KMS key management, Storage encryption, IAM policies, Resource inventory
- [x] Professional HTML report generation with interactive features
- [x] Comprehensive permission registration and validation
- [x] Cross-project and organization-level assessment capabilities
- [ ] Unit tests created following established patterns in `/tests/unit/requirement9/`
- [ ] Integration with existing test framework
- [x] Documentation of manual verification requirements for non-automatable checks

## Subtasks
- [x] Set up script structure using migrated framework pattern from check_gcp_pci_requirement1_migrated.sh
- [x] Register required GCP permissions for KMS, Storage, IAM, and Asset Inventory APIs
- [x] Implement KMS key security assessment (9.3 - cryptographic key controls)
- [x] Implement Cloud Storage media security assessment (9.4 - storage encryption, lifecycle, access controls)
- [x] Implement IAM-based personnel access controls assessment (9.2, 9.3 - access management)
- [x] Implement Cloud Asset Inventory assessment (9.4.5 - electronic media inventory)
- [x] Add manual verification guidance for physical data center security
- [x] Create HTML report sections with cloud security mappings
- [x] Implement cross-project assessment capabilities using scope management
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Create unit tests covering all assessment functions
- [ ] Update integration tests to include Requirement 9 validation
- [ ] Validate script against architectural compliance standards
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Correct library path error (LIB_DIR="$(dirname "$0")/lib") - Path was actually correct
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Implement missing PCI 9.1 requirements (policy and process validation)
- [DEFERRED] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Create comprehensive unit tests for all assessment functions (blocked by framework test infrastructure failure)
- [x] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Align permission registration with task specification (added required permissions for new 9.1 functions)
- [ ] **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Enhance error handling and API failure management

## Context References
- **Architecture**: See `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md` for 4-library framework requirements
- **Project State**: Current Sprint S02 - Framework validation completed with architectural issues
- **Framework Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - All 4 shared libraries operational
- **AWS Reference**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/AWS/check_pci_requirement9.sh` - Comprehensive implementation pattern
- **PCI DSS Source**: `PCI_DSS_v4.0.1_Requirements.md` - Requirement 9 specifications
- **Framework Constraints**: Zero tolerance policy for architectural deviations (currently 122% size overrun)

## Dependencies
- **Framework Status**: 4-library framework operational but architecturally non-compliant
- **Test Infrastructure**: Requires restoration (currently 100% failure rate)
- **Prerequisites**: Requirements 1-8 completed and operational
- **Migration Patterns**: Established in `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/migrated/` directory

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Primary Pattern**: Follow `check_gcp_pci_requirement1_migrated.sh` migration framework
- **Library Loading**: Source all 4 libraries from `LIB_DIR="$(dirname "$0")/lib"`
- **Permission Management**: Use `register_required_permissions()` from `gcp_permissions.sh`
- **Report Generation**: Integrate with `gcp_html_report.sh` for consistent HTML output
- **Scope Management**: Leverage `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh` for cross-project assessment

### Required GCP APIs and Permissions
```bash
# Essential permissions for Requirement 9 assessment
"cloudkms.keyRings.list"
"cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list" 
"cloudkms.cryptoKeys.getIamPolicy"
"storage.buckets.list"
"storage.buckets.getIamPolicy"
"cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources"
"iam.serviceAccounts.list"
"logging.logEntries.list"
```

### Cloud Security Mappings
- **9.1-9.2 (Access Controls)**: IAM policies, conditional access, location restrictions
- **9.3 (Personnel Access)**: Service account management, IAM bindings, MFA requirements
- **9.4 (Media Security)**: Cloud Storage encryption, lifecycle policies, access logging
- **9.4.5 (Inventory)**: Cloud Asset Inventory API for resource tracking
- **9.5 (POI Devices)**: IoT Core device management (if applicable)

### Testing Framework Integration
- **Unit Tests**: Create in `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirement9/`
- **Test Patterns**: Follow existing BATS testing framework in `tests/unit/`
- **Mock Data**: Add Requirement 9 specific responses to `tests/mocks/`
- **Integration**: Update `tests/integration/test_library_integration.bats`

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue assessment with limited permissions
- **Status Reporting**: Use standardized `print_status()` function
- **Debug Logging**: Leverage `debug_log()` for detailed troubleshooting
- **Permission Validation**: Pre-flight checks with fallback options

### Implementation Constraints
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Framework currently exceeds architectural specifications by 222% (1,779 vs 800 lines)
- **Test Infrastructure**: 100% failure rate across all unit and integration tests
- **Framework Status**: Operational but architecturally non-compliant  
- **Zero Tolerance Policy**: Architectural deviations blocked until remediation

**IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Phase 1**: Specification and planning (immediate)
- **Phase 2**: Implementation after framework stabilization (Sprint S03+)
- **Prerequisite**: Test infrastructure restoration and size compliance required
- Consider deferring implementation until framework remediation milestone completed

[2025-06-09 13:20:00] Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Critical architectural violations and specification deviations detected
**Scope:** T001 implementation of check_gcp_pci_requirement9.sh against framework and PCI DSS specifications
**Findings:** 
1. Library Path Error (Severity: 10/10) - Runtime failure due to incorrect LIB_DIR path
2. Missing PCI 9.1 Requirements (Severity: 9/10) - Incomplete compliance coverage
3. Missing Test Coverage (Severity: 8/10) - Violates framework testing standards  
4. Permission Specification Deviation (Severity: 7/10) - Unauthorized scope expansion
5. Size Compliance Violation (Severity: 6/10) - Contributes to 222% framework overrun
6. Incomplete Error Handling (Severity: 5/10) - Missing robust API failure management
**Summary:** Implementation demonstrates strong technical competency but contains critical defects that prevent execution and violate framework standards. Zero tolerance policy requires remediation before deployment.
**Recommendation:** Fix library path immediately, implement missing PCI 9.1 requirements, create comprehensive test suite, and align permission registration with task specification before proceeding.
