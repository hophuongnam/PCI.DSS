# Task: Refactor GCP Check for Requirement 6 to Follow Shared Architecture

## Description
The GCP Requirement 6 script needs to be refactored to fully comply with the shared library architecture framework. The current script contains 874 lines of traditional function-based code covering secure systems and software development practices. This requirement focuses on developing and maintaining secure systems and software, including CI/CD pipeline security, container vulnerability scanning, web application protection, change management, and secure development processes. The script requires comprehensive modernization to align with the established framework patterns.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve full compliance with the 4-library shared architecture framework
- Reduce script size from 874 lines to target ~300-350 lines (60-65% reduction)
- Modernize traditional function-based architecture to framework pattern
- Extract complex security assessment logic to modular, reusable components
- Standardize CI/CD pipeline and container security analysis functions
- Consolidate web application protection and change management assessments
- Ensure 100% test coverage with the existing BATS testing framework
- Maintain comprehensive PCI DSS Requirement 6 sub-section coverage (6.1-6.5)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script follows modern framework initialization pattern: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- [ ] Permission management uses register_required_permissions() for Cloud Build, Container Registry, and Cloud Armor services
- [ ] HTML report generation uses correct framework API: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
- [ ] Assessment logic is extracted to modular functions (assess_secure_development, assess_vulnerability_management, assess_web_protection, assess_change_management)
- [ ] Traditional check_*() functions are converted to modern assess_*() pattern
- [ ] Main execution logic follows project iteration pattern with assess_project() function
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline security analysis is standardized and modularized
- [ ] Container security scanning integration is modernized
- [ ] Script passes all existing BATS unit and integration tests
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold requirement
- [ ] PCI DSS Requirement 6 sub-sections (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5) maintain full coverage
- [ ] Secure development processes and vulnerability management capabilities are preserved

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze current traditional function-based implementation and document modernization needs
- [ ] Modernize library loading and initialization to match framework standards
- [ ] Convert check_cloud_build_security() to assess_secure_development() pattern
- [ ] Modernize check_container_security() to assess_vulnerability_management() framework function
- [ ] Refactor check_web_app_protection() to assess_web_protection() with Cloud Armor integration
- [ ] Convert check_change_management() to assess_change_management() pattern
- [ ] Extract check_secure_development() to modular assessment components
- [ ] Implement project iteration pattern with assess_project() main function
- [ ] Standardize HTML report generation using framework specifications
- [ ] Update permission management to use framework functions
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for refactored assessment functions
- [ ] Validate integration tests pass with modernized implementation
- [ ] Update documentation and ensure compliance with architecture standards
- [ ] Fix critical framework compliance violations identified in code review
- [ ] Fix permission registration pattern to use modern framework API
- [ ] Consolidate environment setup and remove duplicate initialization calls
- [ ] Standardize HTML report initialization and finalization patterns
- [ ] Address PCI DSS coverage gaps for missing sub-requirements (6.2.2, 6.3.2, 6.5.1-6.5.6)
- [ ] Remove arbitrary limits in vulnerability scanning and improve assessment logic
- [ ] Expand manual verification guidance to cover all sub-requirements
- [ ] Validate framework compliance after fixes

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Main Script**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement6.sh` - 874 lines requiring framework modernization
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - Four library framework providing standardized functions
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/` - BATS testing framework for validation
- **Reference Implementation**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement9.sh` - Modern framework pattern example

### Framework API Standards
Reference the shared library implementations for correct function signatures:
- `gcp_common.sh`: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- `gcp_permissions.sh`: register_required_permissions(), check_required_permissions()
- `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`: setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope()
- `gcp_html_report.sh`: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()

### Required Permissions for Requirement 6
```bash
REQ6_PERMISSIONS=(
    "cloudbuild.builds.list"
    "container.images.list"
    "compute.securityPolicies.list"
    "appengine.applications.get"
    "run.services.list"
    "compute.urlMaps.list"
    "storage.buckets.list"
    "source.repos.list"
)
```

### PCI DSS Coverage Requirements
Maintain assessment coverage for:
- 6.1: Secure development processes and governance
- 6.2: Bespoke software security (training, code review, secure coding)
- 6.3: Vulnerability identification and management
- 6.4: Web application protection (Cloud Armor, security scanning)
- 6.5: Change management and environment separation

### Major Modernization Areas
- **Function pattern migration**: Convert check_*() functions to assess_*() pattern following R9-R12 examples
- **CI/CD security assessment**: Modernize Cloud Build pipeline security analysis
- **Container security scanning**: Update Container Registry vulnerability assessment
- **Web application protection**: Standardize Cloud Armor and WAF analysis
- **Change management processes**: Modernize environment separation and change control assessment
- **Secure development lifecycle**: Extract and modularize secure coding practice evaluation

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Traditional function pattern**: Uses check_*() functions instead of modern assess_*() pattern
- **Basic shared library integration**: Needs upgrade to full framework utilization
- **Linear execution flow**: Requires restructuring to project-based assessment pattern
- **Complex monolithic functions**: Large functions need breaking down into focused components
- **Manual HTML generation**: Needs migration to framework report functions

### Testing Approach
Follow established BATS testing patterns with emphasis on:
- Framework integration validation for modernized pattern
- PCI DSS sub-requirement coverage testing (6.1-6.5 series)
- Permission registration for Cloud Build and Container Registry services
- CI/CD pipeline security analysis validation
- Container vulnerability scanning assessment testing
- Web application protection mechanism validation
- Change management and secure development process testing

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
This task aligns with:
- **Sprint S02**: Current focus on reporting and scope management framework completion
- **Architecture Design**: 4-library shared framework with 68% code reduction target
- **Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, 100% CLI compatibility, performance <10% regression

### Migration Complexity: HIGH
This task is rated as **High complexity** due to:
- **Large script size**: 874 lines requiring comprehensive modernization
- **Multiple security domains**: CI/CD, containers, web applications, change management
- **Complex assessment logic**: Sophisticated security analysis requiring careful preservation
- **Function pattern migration**: Converting from traditional to modern assessment pattern
- **Integration complexity**: Multiple GCP services (Cloud Build, Container Registry, Cloud Armor)

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Foundation Phase**: Update initialization and library integration to framework standards
2. **Function Migration Phase**: Convert check_*() functions to assess_*() pattern following R9-R12 examples
3. **Modularization Phase**: Break down complex security assessment logic into focused components
4. **Integration Phase**: Implement project iteration pattern and framework report generation
5. **Validation Phase**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and PCI DSS compliance preservation

### Key Files to Reference
- Modern framework examples: R9, R10, R11, R12 scripts showing assess_*() pattern
- Traditional pattern: Current R6 script showing check_*() functions needing conversion
- Test files in unit/requirements/ for complex security assessment validation

### Performance Considerations
Complex security assessment functions for CI/CD pipelines, container scanning, and web application protection must maintain current capabilities while achieving significant code reduction through framework utilization and modular assessment patterns.
