# Task: Refactor GCP Check for Requirement 5 to Follow Shared Architecture

## Description
The GCP Requirement 5 script needs to be refactored to fully comply with the shared library architecture framework. While the script already loads all 4 shared libraries, it follows an older integration pattern that requires modernization to match the current framework standards. The script contains 572 lines of mixed-architecture code covering malicious software protection and requires significant restructuring to align with the established patterns. This requirement focuses on protecting systems and networks from malicious software, including anti-malware solutions, maintenance monitoring, and anti-phishing mechanisms.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve full compliance with the 4-library shared architecture framework
- Reduce script size from 572 lines to target ~200-250 lines (55-60% reduction)
- Modernize existing library integration to match current framework standards
- Restructure monolithic assessment functions into modular, reusable components
- Standardize HTML report generation using framework specifications
- Consolidate permission management using centralized framework functions
- Ensure 100% test coverage with the existing BATS testing framework
- Maintain comprehensive PCI DSS Requirement 5 sub-section coverage (5.1-5.4)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script follows modern framework initialization pattern: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- [ ] Permission management uses register_required_permissions() for compute and security services
- [ ] HTML report generation uses correct framework API: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
- [ ] Assessment logic is extracted to modular functions (assess_antimalware_solutions, assess_malware_detection, assess_antiphishing_mechanisms)
- [ ] Large monolithic functions are broken down into focused, reusable components
- [ ] Main execution logic follows project iteration pattern with assess_project() function
- [ ] Manual scope validation is replaced with framework scope management functions
- [ ] Script passes all existing BATS unit and integration tests
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold requirement
- [ ] PCI DSS Requirement 5 sub-sections (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) maintain full coverage
- [ ] Anti-malware detection and monitoring capabilities are preserved and enhanced

## Subtasks
- [x] Analyze current mixed-architecture implementation and document modernization needs
- [x] Modernize library loading and initialization to match framework standards
- [x] Migrate permission management from manual checks to framework functions
- [x] Restructure main execution logic to follow project iteration pattern
- [x] Break down large assessment functions into modular components
- [x] Standardize HTML report generation using framework specifications
- [x] Replace manual scope validation with framework scope management

- [x] Implement anti-phishing mechanism assessment modularization
- [x] Update error handling and logging to use framework patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for refactored assessment functions
- [ ] Validate integration tests pass with modernized implementation
- [ ] Update documentation and ensure compliance with architecture standards

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Main Script**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement5.sh` - 572 lines requiring modernization
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - Four library framework providing standardized functions
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/` - BATS testing framework for validation
- **Reference Implementation**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/migrated/check_gcp_pci_requirement3_migrated.sh` - Template for modern framework pattern

### Framework API Standards
Reference the shared library implementations for correct function signatures:
- `gcp_common.sh`: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- `gcp_permissions.sh`: register_required_permissions(), check_required_permissions()
- `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`: setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope()
- `gcp_html_report.sh`: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()

### Required Permissions for Requirement 5
```bash
REQ5_PERMISSIONS=(
    "compute.instances.list"
    "compute.instanceTemplates.list"
    "compute.instanceGroupManagers.list"
    "compute.autoscalers.list"
    "compute.metadata.get"
    "compute.projects.get"
    "resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy"
)
```

### PCI DSS Coverage Requirements
Maintain assessment coverage for:
- 5.1: Processes and mechanisms for protecting systems from malicious software
- 5.2: Malware prevention, detection, and addressing mechanisms
- 5.3: Anti-malware mechanisms maintenance and monitoring
- 5.4: Anti-phishing mechanisms implementation and monitoring

### Major Modernization Areas
- **Framework integration structure**: Simplify library loading (lines 6-13) and adopt unified initialization
- **Permission management**: Replace manual checks (lines 404-460) with centralized framework functions
- **Assessment functions**: Modularize large functions (check_gce_antimalware: 115 lines, check_antimalware_updates: 77 lines)
- **Report generation**: Replace manual HTML manipulation with framework functions
- **Main execution logic**: Extract into clean main() function with project iteration pattern
- **Scope management**: Replace manual validation (lines 361-375) with framework functions

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Mixed integration pattern**: Uses shared libraries but follows older integration approach
- **Monolithic functions**: Large assessment functions need breaking down into focused components
- **Manual HTML generation**: Direct HTML manipulation instead of framework report functions
- **Scattered permission checks**: Manual permission validation distributed throughout code
- **Linear execution flow**: Needs restructuring to project-based assessment pattern

### Testing Approach
Follow established BATS testing patterns with emphasis on:
- Framework integration validation for modernized pattern
- PCI DSS sub-requirement coverage testing (5.1-5.4 series)
- Permission registration for compute and security services
- Anti-malware solution detection and monitoring validation
- Anti-phishing mechanism assessment testing
- Modular assessment function unit testing
- Error handling for malware detection workflows

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
This task aligns with:
- **Sprint S02**: Current focus on reporting and scope management framework completion
- **Architecture Design**: 4-library shared framework with 68% code reduction target
- **Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, 100% CLI compatibility, performance <10% regression

### Migration Complexity: HIGH
This task is rated as **High complexity** due to:
- **Significant restructuring**: 60% of code requires modernization from mixed-architecture to framework pattern
- **Function modularization**: 4 large monolithic functions need breaking down into focused components
- **Report generation overhaul**: Replace 20+ manual HTML calls with framework functions
- **Permission system migration**: Replace 50+ lines of manual checks with centralized framework
- **Assessment logic preservation**: Complex malware detection and anti-phishing logic must be maintained

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Modernization Phase**: Update initialization, library loading, and permission management to framework standards
2. **Restructuring Phase**: Extract main execution logic and implement project iteration pattern
3. **Modularization Phase**: Break down large assessment functions into focused, reusable components
4. **Standardization Phase**: Replace manual HTML generation with framework report functions
5. **Validation Phase**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and PCI DSS compliance preservation

### Key Files to Modify
- Primary script requiring comprehensive modernization from mixed to framework architecture
- Test files in unit/requirements/ for modular assessment function validation
- Integration tests for anti-malware and anti-phishing assessment workflows

### Performance Considerations
Malware detection and monitoring functions must maintain current assessment capabilities while achieving significant code reduction through proper framework utilization and efficient modular assessment patterns.
