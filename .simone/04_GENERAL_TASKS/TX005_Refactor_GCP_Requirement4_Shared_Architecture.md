# Task: Refactor GCP Check for Requirement 4 to Follow Shared Architecture

## Description
The GCP Requirement 4 script needs to be refactored to fully comply with the shared library architecture framework. The current script contains 792 lines of legacy monolithic code with significant duplication and architectural violations. Unlike Requirement 3 which was partially migrated, Requirement 4 remains completely in the legacy pattern with no migrated versions available. This script covers critical PCI DSS data-in-transit protections including TLS/SSL configurations, certificate management, wireless security, and cryptographic implementations across multiple GCP services.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve full compliance with the 4-library shared architecture framework
- Reduce script size from 792 lines to target ~280-320 lines (60-65% reduction)
- Eliminate extensive code duplication in header sections, permission checks, and validation logic
- Standardize all library API usage to match framework specifications
- Extract complex TLS/SSL analysis logic to modular, reusable functions
- Ensure 100% test coverage with the existing BATS testing framework
- Maintain comprehensive PCI DSS Requirement 4 sub-section coverage (4.1-4.2)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script uses all 4 shared libraries (gcp_common.sh, gcp_html_report.sh, gcp_permissions.sh, gcp_scope_mgmt.sh) with correct API signatures
- [ ] Script follows standardized initialization pattern: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- [ ] Permission management uses register_required_permissions() for compute services (SSL policies, HTTPS proxies, forwarding rules, etc.)
- [ ] HTML report generation uses correct framework API: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
- [ ] Scope management properly uses setup_assessment_scope() and get_projects_in_scope()
- [ ] Assessment logic is extracted to modular functions (assess_tls_configurations, assess_ssl_certificates, assess_unencrypted_services, assess_cloud_cdn_armor)
- [ ] Code duplication in header sections and counter resets is eliminated
- [ ] Script passes all existing BATS unit and integration tests
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold requirement
- [ ] PCI DSS Requirement 4 sub-sections (4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.1.1, 4.2.1.2, 4.2.2) maintain full coverage
- [ ] Specialized TLS/SSL analysis and certificate validation functions are preserved and enhanced

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze current script architecture and document specific duplication patterns
- [ ] Standardize library loading and environment setup to framework pattern
- [ ] Migrate permission management to use framework functions for compute services
- [ ] Implement proper scope management integration for project iteration
- [ ] Extract and modularize TLS configuration analysis functions
- [ ] Abstract SSL certificate management and validation logic
- [ ] Consolidate firewall rule analysis into reusable components
- [ ] Refactor Cloud CDN and Cloud Armor assessment functions
- [ ] Update HTML report generation to use framework specifications
- [ ] Implement standardized error handling and logging patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for refactored assessment functions
- [ ] Validate integration tests pass with refactored implementation
- [ ] Update documentation and ensure compliance with architecture standards

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Main Script**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement4.sh` - 792 lines requiring comprehensive refactoring
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - Four library framework providing standardized functions
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/` - BATS testing framework for validation
- **Reference Implementation**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/migrated/check_gcp_pci_requirement3_migrated.sh` - Template for migration pattern

### Framework API Standards
Reference the shared library implementations for correct function signatures:
- `gcp_common.sh`: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- `gcp_permissions.sh`: register_required_permissions(), check_required_permissions()
- `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`: setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope()
- `gcp_html_report.sh`: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()

### Required Permissions for Requirement 4
```bash
REQ4_PERMISSIONS=(
    "compute.sslPolicies.list"
    "compute.targetHttpsProxies.list"
    "compute.urlMaps.list"
    "compute.forwardingRules.list"
    "compute.backendServices.list"
    "compute.securityPolicies.list"
    "compute.sslCertificates.list"
    "compute.firewalls.list"
)
```

### PCI DSS Coverage Requirements
Maintain assessment coverage for:
- 4.1.1: Security policies and operational procedures documentation
- 4.1.2: Roles and responsibilities for transmission security
- 4.2.1: Strong cryptography for PAN transmission over public networks
- 4.2.1.1: Inventory of trusted keys and certificates
- 4.2.1.2: Wireless network security with strong cryptography
- 4.2.2: PAN security in end-user messaging technologies

### Major Code Consolidation Opportunities
- **Duplicate headers elimination**: Lines 67-84, 236-258, 342-365, 468-490 (remove ~60 lines)
- **Counter reset consolidation**: Lines 85-90, 253-258, 359-364, 485-490 (remove ~30 lines)
- **Manual scope validation replacement**: Lines 565-596 with shared framework functions (remove ~30 lines)
- **GCP command abstraction**: Abstract direct gcloud command usage (~100 line reduction)
- **Assessment function modularization**: Extract specialized TLS/SSL logic (~150 line reduction)

### Testing Approach
Follow established BATS testing patterns with emphasis on:
- Syntax and structure validation for complex assessment functions
- 4-library framework integration tests
- PCI DSS sub-requirement coverage validation (4.1-4.2 series)
- Permission registration for compute services
- TLS/SSL configuration analysis validation
- Certificate management and expiration checking
- Firewall rule analysis and reporting
- Error handling for complex GCP service interactions

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
This task aligns with:
- **Sprint S02**: Current focus on reporting and scope management framework completion
- **Architecture Design**: 4-library shared framework with 68% code reduction target
- **Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, 100% CLI compatibility, performance <10% regression

### Migration Complexity: HIGH
This task is rated as **High complexity** due to:
- **Specialized Assessment Logic**: Complex TLS/SSL configuration analysis requiring careful preservation
- **Multiple GCP Service Integration**: Load Balancers, Cloud CDN, Cloud Armor, SSL certificates
- **Certificate Management**: Date parsing, validation, and expiry monitoring with OS-specific handling
- **Security Analysis**: Firewall rules, encryption protocols, and cryptographic strength evaluation
- **No Existing Migration**: Unlike Requirement 3, no partial migration exists as a reference

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Foundation Phase**: Update library loading, permission registration, and environment setup
2. **Abstraction Phase**: Extract TLS/SSL analysis into shared utilities and modular functions
3. **Consolidation Phase**: Eliminate code duplication and standardize GCP command execution
4. **Assessment Migration**: Convert specialized functions to project-based assessment pattern
5. **Validation Phase**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and PCI DSS compliance preservation

### Key Files to Modify or Create
- Primary script requiring complete architectural refactoring
- Potential new shared utilities for TLS/SSL analysis in lib/ directory
- Test files in unit/requirements/ for complex assessment function validation
- Integration tests for multi-service GCP assessment workflows

### Performance Considerations
Complex TLS/SSL analysis and certificate validation functions must maintain current performance levels while achieving significant code reduction through shared library utilization and efficient GCP service discovery patterns.
