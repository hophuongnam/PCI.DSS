# Task: GCP Requirement 2 Framework Integration and Coverage Analysis

## Description
Analyze and improve the GCP PCI DSS Requirement 2 script integration with the shared architecture framework, and establish comprehensive test coverage. While the Requirement 2 script has been migrated to use shared libraries, analysis reveals several integration inconsistencies and gaps in test coverage that need to be addressed to achieve project quality standards.

The current implementation has 4 different versions with varying levels of framework integration, uses deprecated functions, and lacks the comprehensive test coverage required for production deployment.

## Goal / Objectives
- Consolidate and standardize GCP Requirement 2 script integration with the 4-library shared framework
- Establish comprehensive test coverage for Requirement 2 scripts following the proven Requirement 1 testing patterns
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage as required by project quality gates
- Ensure consistent framework usage patterns across all Requirement 2 implementations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All undefined functions in Requirement 2 scripts are replaced with proper shared library functions
- [ ] Variable references are updated to use shared library standards (ORG_ID, PROJECT_ID)
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests are implemented following the Requirement 1 test pattern
- [ ] Integration tests are created for all Requirement 2 script versions
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 90%+ for Requirement 2 implementations
- [ ] HTML report generation uses standardized shared report functions
- [ ] Framework integration inconsistencies are resolved
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect proper integration patterns

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit current Requirement 2 script versions for framework integration issues
- [ ] Fix undefined function calls (run_gcp_command_across_projects, add_html_section)
- [ ] Update variable references to use shared library standards
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests (test_requirement2_scripts.bats)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for all script versions
- [ ] Develop Requirement 2-specific mock data for testing
- [ ] Establish test coverage baselines and reporting
- [ ] Consolidate multiple script versions into canonical implementation
- [ ] Validate framework integration patterns against architecture standards
- [ ] Update documentation with proper integration examples

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
**Requirement 2 Script Locations:**
- Primary: `GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement2.sh` (679 lines) - Main framework-integrated version
- Enhanced: `GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement2_integrated.sh` (988 lines) - Comprehensive checks
- Migrated: `GCP/migrated/check_gcp_pci_requirement2_migrated.sh` (398 lines) - Modern framework patterns
- Backup: `GCP/backup/check_gcp_pci_requirement2.sh` (992 lines) - Legacy standalone

**Shared Library Framework:**
- `GCP/lib/gcp_common.sh` - Core utilities, environment setup, CLI parsing (470 lines)
- `GCP/lib/gcp_permissions.sh` - Permission validation and role management (316 lines)
- `GCP/lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh` - Project/organization scope handling (295 lines)
- `GCP/lib/gcp_html_report.sh` - Modular HTML report generation (879 lines)

### Implementation Notes

**Critical Integration Fixes Required:**
1. Replace `run_gcp_command_across_projects()` with `run_across_projects()` from `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`
2. Replace `add_html_section()` with `add_section()` and `add_check_result()` from `gcp_html_report.sh`
3. Update `DEFAULT_ORG`/`DEFAULT_PROJECT` references to use `ORG_ID`/`PROJECT_ID` from shared scope
4. Standardize library loading patterns across all script versions

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Follow pattern in `GCP/tests/unit/requirements/test_requirement1_scripts.bats`
- Use existing test framework: `GCP/tests/helpers/test_helpers.bash`
- Leverage mock system: `GCP/tests/mocks/gcloud` and response data
- Target 90%+ coverage using kcov configuration in `GCP/tests/helpers/coverage_helpers.bash`

**Framework Standards:**
- Use standardized initialization: `setup_environment()`, `parse_common_arguments()`, `setup_assessment_scope()`
- Follow permission checking pattern: `check_required_permissions()` with required GCP permissions
- Implement consistent error handling and logging patterns from shared libraries
- Use modular HTML report generation with collapsible sections and interactive features

**Performance Considerations:**
- Benchmark against migrated version showing 59.7% code reduction (991â†’399 lines)
- Maintain API efficiency patterns established in shared libraries
- Follow memory usage optimization patterns from framework design
