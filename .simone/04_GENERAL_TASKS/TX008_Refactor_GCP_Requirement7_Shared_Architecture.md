# Task: Refactor GCP Check for Requirement 7 to Follow Shared Architecture

## Description
The GCP Requirement 7 script needs to be refactored to fully comply with the shared library architecture framework. The current script contains 824 lines of traditional function-based code covering access control by business need-to-know principles. This requirement focuses on restricting access based on business roles and responsibilities, including IAM policy analysis, service account management, least privilege implementation, and access control system configuration. The script requires comprehensive modernization to align with the established framework patterns.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve full compliance with the 4-library shared architecture framework
- Reduce script size from 824 lines to target ~280-320 lines (60-65% reduction)
- Modernize traditional function-based architecture to framework pattern
- Extract complex IAM and access control analysis to modular, reusable components
- Standardize overly permissive policy detection and service account lifecycle management
- Consolidate least privilege and access control system assessments
- Ensure 100% test coverage with the existing BATS testing framework
- Maintain comprehensive PCI DSS Requirement 7 sub-section coverage (7.1-7.3)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script follows modern framework initialization pattern: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- [ ] Permission management uses register_required_permissions() for IAM, VPC, and Identity-Aware Proxy services
- [ ] HTML report generation uses correct framework API: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()
- [ ] Assessment logic is extracted to modular functions (assess_access_governance, assess_role_based_access, assess_access_control_systems)
- [ ] Traditional check_*() functions are converted to modern assess_*() pattern
- [ ] Main execution logic follows project iteration pattern with assess_project() function
- [ ] IAM policy analysis is standardized and modularized
- [ ] Service account lifecycle management assessment is modernized
- [ ] Script passes all existing BATS unit and integration tests
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold requirement
- [ ] PCI DSS Requirement 7 sub-sections (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) maintain full coverage
- [ ] Access control governance and least privilege enforcement capabilities are preserved

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze current traditional function-based implementation and document modernization needs
- [ ] Modernize library loading and initialization to match framework standards
- [ ] Convert check_overly_permissive_policies() to assess_access_governance() pattern
- [ ] Modernize check_inactive_service_accounts() to assess_role_based_access() framework function
- [ ] Refactor check_least_privilege() to assess_access_control_systems() with VPC and IAP integration
- [ ] Convert check_access_control_systems() to standardized assessment pattern
- [ ] Extract IAM policy analysis logic to modular assessment components
- [ ] Implement project iteration pattern with assess_project() main function
- [ ] Standardize HTML report generation using framework specifications
- [ ] Update permission management to use framework functions
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for refactored assessment functions
- [ ] Validate integration tests pass with modernized implementation
- [ ] Update documentation and ensure compliance with architecture standards

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Main Script**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement7.sh` - 824 lines requiring framework modernization
- **Shared Libraries**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/lib/` - Four library framework providing standardized functions
- **Test Suite**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/tests/unit/requirements/` - BATS testing framework for validation
- **Reference Implementation**: `/Users/namhp/Resilio.Sync/PCI.DSS/GCP/check_gcp_pci_requirement9.sh` - Modern framework pattern example

### Framework API Standards
Reference the shared library implementations for correct function signatures:
- `gcp_common.sh`: setup_environment(), parse_common_arguments(), validate_prerequisites()
- `gcp_permissions.sh`: register_required_permissions(), check_required_permissions()
- `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`: setup_assessment_scope(), get_projects_in_scope()
- `gcp_html_report.sh`: initialize_report(), add_section(), add_check_result(), finalize_report()

### Required Permissions for Requirement 7
```bash
REQ7_PERMISSIONS=(
    "resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy"
    "iam.serviceAccounts.list"
    "iam.roles.list"
    "compute.networks.list"
    "compute.subnetworks.list"
    "iap.web.getIamPolicy"
    "compute.firewalls.list"
    "storage.buckets.getIamPolicy"
)
```

### PCI DSS Coverage Requirements
Maintain assessment coverage for:
- 7.1: Access control governance and procedures
- 7.2: Role-based access control and least privilege implementation
- 7.3: Access control system implementation with default-deny policies

### Major Modernization Areas
- **Function pattern migration**: Convert check_*() functions to assess_*() pattern following R9-R12 examples
- **IAM policy analysis**: Modernize overly permissive policy detection and role analysis
- **Service account management**: Update inactive service account lifecycle assessment
- **Least privilege enforcement**: Standardize privilege escalation and access review analysis
- **Access control systems**: Modernize VPC and Identity-Aware Proxy configuration assessment
- **Business need validation**: Extract and modularize role-based access control evaluation

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Traditional function pattern**: Uses check_*() functions instead of modern assess_*() pattern
- **Basic shared library integration**: Needs upgrade to full framework utilization
- **Linear execution flow**: Requires restructuring to project-based assessment pattern
- **Complex monolithic functions**: Large IAM analysis functions need breaking down into focused components
- **Manual HTML generation**: Needs migration to framework report functions

### Testing Approach
Follow established BATS testing patterns with emphasis on:
- Framework integration validation for modernized pattern
- PCI DSS sub-requirement coverage testing (7.1-7.3 series)
- Permission registration for IAM and access control services
- IAM policy analysis and overly permissive policy detection validation
- Service account lifecycle management assessment testing
- Least privilege enforcement and role-based access control validation
- VPC and Identity-Aware Proxy configuration assessment testing

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Compliance
This task aligns with:
- **Sprint S02**: Current focus on reporting and scope management framework completion
- **Architecture Design**: 4-library shared framework with 68% code reduction target
- **Quality Standards**: 90% test coverage, 100% CLI compatibility, performance <10% regression

### Migration Complexity: HIGH
This task is rated as **High complexity** due to:
- **Large script size**: 824 lines requiring comprehensive modernization
- **Complex IAM analysis**: Sophisticated policy analysis and role-based access control logic
- **Multiple access control domains**: IAM, VPC, Identity-Aware Proxy, service accounts
- **Function pattern migration**: Converting from traditional to modern assessment pattern
- **Business logic preservation**: Complex access control governance requiring careful maintenance

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Foundation Phase**: Update initialization and library integration to framework standards
2. **Function Migration Phase**: Convert check_*() functions to assess_*() pattern following R9-R12 examples
3. **Modularization Phase**: Break down complex IAM and access control analysis into focused components
4. **Integration Phase**: Implement project iteration pattern and framework report generation
5. **Validation Phase**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage and PCI DSS compliance preservation

### Key Files to Reference
- Modern framework examples: R9, R10, R11, R12 scripts showing assess_*() pattern
- Traditional pattern: Current R7 script showing check_*() functions needing conversion
- Test files in unit/requirements/ for complex access control assessment validation

### Performance Considerations
Complex IAM policy analysis, service account management, and access control system assessment functions must maintain current capabilities while achieving significant code reduction through framework utilization and modular assessment patterns.
