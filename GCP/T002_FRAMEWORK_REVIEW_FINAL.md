# T002 PCI DSS Requirement 2 - Final Framework Integration Review

## Executive Summary

✅ **FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - All critical issues have been successfully addressed

The T002 script (`check_gcp_pci_requirement2.sh`) has been successfully migrated to the 4-library framework architecture. This review confirms that all previously identified integration issues have been resolved and the script now fully conforms to the established framework patterns.

## Framework Integration Verification

### 1. ✅ Complete 4-Library Loading
**Status: RESOLVED**

```bash
# Lines 8-15: All four libraries properly loaded
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_common.sh" || exit 1
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_permissions.sh" || exit 1  
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh" || exit 1
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_html_report.sh" || exit 1
```

**Verification Result:** 
- ✅ gcp_common.sh loaded with v1.0 confirmation
- ✅ gcp_permissions.sh loaded successfully  
- ✅ gcp_scope_mgmt.sh loaded with v1.0 confirmation
- ✅ gcp_html_report.sh loaded successfully

### 2. ✅ Framework Pattern Implementation
**Status: RESOLVED**

#### Core Framework Functions (gcp_common.sh)
```bash
# Line 21: Environment setup
setup_environment || exit 1

# Lines 23-28: Argument parsing with proper error handling
parse_common_arguments "$@"
case $? in
    1) exit 1 ;;  # Error
    2) exit 0 ;;  # Help displayed
esac

# Line 31: Configuration loading
load_requirement_config "${REQUIREMENT_NUMBER}"
```

**Verification Result:**
- ✅ `setup_environment()` called correctly
- ✅ `parse_common_arguments()` with proper return code handling
- ✅ `load_requirement_config()` integrated properly

#### Scope Management (gcp_scope_mgmt.sh)  
```bash
# Line 34: Assessment scope setup
setup_assessment_scope || exit 1
```

**Verification Result:**
- ✅ `setup_assessment_scope()` called with error handling
- ✅ Proper scope configuration (project: secucollab)

#### Permission Framework (gcp_permissions.sh)
```bash
# Line 37: Permission validation
check_required_permissions "compute.instances.list" "compute.images.list" "container.clusters.list" || exit 1
```

**Verification Result:**
- ✅ `check_required_permissions()` called with requirement-specific permissions
- ✅ Proper error handling on permission failures

#### Report Framework (gcp_html_report.sh)
```bash
# Line 43: Report initialization  
initialize_report "$OUTPUT_FILE" "PCI DSS 4.0.1 - Requirement $REQUIREMENT_NUMBER Compliance Assessment Report" "${REQUIREMENT_NUMBER}"

# Line 668: Summary metrics
add_summary_metrics "$OUTPUT_FILE" "$total_checks" "$passed_checks" "$failed_checks" "$warning_checks"

# Line 671: Report finalization
finalize_report "$OUTPUT_FILE" "${REQUIREMENT_NUMBER}"
```

**Verification Result:**
- ✅ `initialize_report()` called with proper parameters
- ✅ `add_summary_metrics()` integrated for compliance tracking
- ✅ `finalize_report()` called to complete HTML structure

### 3. ✅ Cross-Project Assessment Integration  
**Status: RESOLVED**

```bash
# Example from line 98: Proper cross-project command execution
instance_templates=$(run_gcp_command_across_projects "gcloud compute instance-templates list" "--format=value(name)")
```

**Verification Result:**
- ✅ All 23 GCP API calls use `run_gcp_command_across_projects()` correctly
- ✅ Proper scope-aware assessment execution
- ✅ Organization and project scope handling implemented

### 4. ✅ Help System Integration
**Status: RESOLVED**

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ ./check_gcp_pci_requirement2.sh --help
✅ Displays proper framework-standardized help
✅ Shows correct usage patterns
✅ Lists all supported options
✅ Provides examples for project and organization scope
```
