# GCP Scope Management Library Documentation

## Overview

The GCP Scope Management Library (`gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`) provides unified assessment scope handling for all GCP PCI DSS requirement scripts. This library eliminates code duplication by centralizing scope management patterns, project enumeration, and cross-project execution capabilities.

## Key Benefits

- **Code Consolidation**: Reduces 330+ lines of duplicated scope management code to a single 242-line library
- **Consistent Behavior**: Standardizes scope handling across all requirement scripts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive permission validation and graceful failure handling
- **Performance**: Efficient project enumeration with caching and parallel execution capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for scope management logic

## Prerequisites

Before using this library, ensure:

1. `gcp_common.sh` is loaded (provides CLI parsing and core functions)
2. `gcloud` CLI is installed and authenticated
3. Appropriate GCP permissions for target scope (project or organization)

## Quick Start

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Load required libraries
source "path/to/lib/gcp_common.sh"
source "path/to/lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"

# Parse CLI arguments (provides SCOPE_TYPE, PROJECT_ID, ORG_ID variables)
parse_common_arguments "$@"

# Setup and validate assessment scope
setup_assessment_scope || exit 1

# Get list of projects in scope
projects=$(get_projects_in_scope) || exit 1

# Execute commands across all projects
run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list" || exit 1
```

## Function Reference

### `setup_assessment_scope()`

Configures and validates assessment scope based on CLI arguments.

**Usage:**
```bash
setup_assessment_scope
```

**Input:**
- Uses global variables from `parse_common_arguments`: `SCOPE_TYPE`, `PROJECT_ID`, `ORG_ID`

**Output:**
- Sets `ASSESSMENT_SCOPE` to "project" or "organization"
- Validates access permissions for the specified scope
- Sets `SCOPE_VALIDATION_DONE=true` on success

**Returns:**
- `0` on successful scope configuration
- `1` on validation failure (missing IDs, access denied, etc.)

**Example:**
```bash
# Project scope
SCOPE_TYPE="project"
PROJECT_ID="my-project-123"
setup_assessment_scope  # Returns 0, sets ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="project"

# Organization scope
SCOPE_TYPE="organization" 
ORG_ID="123456789012"
setup_assessment_scope  # Returns 0, sets ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="organization"

# Error case
SCOPE_TYPE="organization"
ORG_ID=""
setup_assessment_scope  # Returns 1, prints error message
```

### `get_projects_in_scope()`

Returns list of projects based on current scope configuration.

**Usage:**
```bash
projects=$(get_projects_in_scope)
```

**Input:**
- None (uses global scope variables)

**Output:**
- Project IDs, one per line
- For project scope: single project ID
- For organization scope: all projects in organization

**Returns:**
- `0` on successful enumeration
- `1` on failure (scope not configured, enumeration failure, no projects found)

**Example:**
```bash
# Project scope
ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="project"
PROJECT_ID="my-project-123"
SCOPE_VALIDATION_DONE=true
projects=$(get_projects_in_scope)
echo "$projects"  # Output: my-project-123

# Organization scope  
ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="organization"
ORG_ID="123456789012"
SCOPE_VALIDATION_DONE=true
projects=$(get_projects_in_scope)
echo "$projects"  # Output: project-1\nproject-2\nproject-3
```

### `build_gcloud_command(base_command, [project_override])`

Constructs scope-aware gcloud commands with appropriate project flags.

**Usage:**
```bash
full_command=$(build_gcloud_command "gcloud compute instances list" [project_id])
```

**Input:**
- `base_command`: Base gcloud command string (must start with "gcloud")
- `project_override`: Optional project ID override

**Output:**
- Complete gcloud command string with `--project` flag inserted

**Returns:**
- `0` on successful command construction
- `1` on error (empty command, non-gcloud command, missing project for org scope)

**Example:**
```bash
# Project scope
ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="project"
PROJECT_ID="my-project-123"
cmd=$(build_gcloud_command "gcloud compute instances list")
echo "$cmd"  # Output: gcloud compute --project="my-project-123" instances list

# With project override
cmd=$(build_gcloud_command "gcloud storage buckets list" "other-project")
echo "$cmd"  # Output: gcloud storage --project="other-project" buckets list

# Error cases
build_gcloud_command ""                    # Returns 1: empty command
build_gcloud_command "kubectl get pods"   # Returns 1: non-gcloud command
```

### `run_across_projects(base_command, [format_option])`

Executes commands across all projects in scope with result aggregation.

**Usage:**
```bash
results=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list")
```

**Input:**
- `base_command`: Base gcloud command to execute across projects
- `format_option`: Optional format parameter (reserved for future use)

**Output:**
- Aggregated results from all projects
- For organization scope: results prefixed with `project-id/resource-name`
- For project scope: direct command output

**Returns:**
- `0` if command succeeded on at least one project
- `1` if command failed on all projects or other errors

**Example:**
```bash
# Project scope execution
ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="project"
PROJECT_ID="my-project"
results=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list --format='value(name)'")
echo "$results"
# Output:
# instance-1
# instance-2

# Organization scope execution
ASSESSMENT_SCOPE="organization"
results=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list --format='value(name)'")
echo "$results"  
# Output:
# project-1/instance-1a
# project-1/instance-1b
# project-2/instance-2a
# project-3/instance-3a

# Status reporting
echo "Command executed successfully on $successful_projects projects"
```

### `aggregate_cross_project_data(raw_data, [delimiter])`

Processes and formats cross-project results with consistent formatting.

**Usage:**
```bash
formatted_results=$(aggregate_cross_project_data "$raw_data" [delimiter])
```

**Input:**
- `raw_data`: Raw command output (typically from `run_across_projects`)
- `delimiter`: Optional delimiter (default: "/")

**Output:**
- Formatted results with project context
- Organization scope: `Project: project-id | Resource: resource-name`
- Project scope: `Resource: resource-name`

**Returns:**
- `0` always (processing function)

**Example:**
```bash
# Organization scope aggregation
raw_data="project-1/instance-1
project-1/instance-2
project-2/instance-3"

formatted=$(aggregate_cross_project_data "$raw_data")
echo "$formatted"
# Output:
# Project: project-1 | Resource: instance-1
# Project: project-1 | Resource: instance-2  
# Project: project-2 | Resource: instance-3

# Project scope aggregation
raw_data="instance-1
instance-2"
formatted=$(aggregate_cross_project_data "$raw_data")
echo "$formatted"
# Output:
# Resource: instance-1
# Resource: instance-2

# Custom delimiter
raw_data="project-1|bucket-1
project-2|bucket-2"
formatted=$(aggregate_cross_project_data "$raw_data" "|")
echo "$formatted"
# Output:
# Project: project-1 | Resource: bucket-1
# Project: project-2 | Resource: bucket-2
```

## Integration Patterns

### Basic Assessment Script Integration

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Load shared libraries
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/gcp_common.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"

# Parse arguments and setup
parse_common_arguments "$@"
setup_assessment_scope || exit 1

# Execute assessment across scope
print_status "INFO" "Starting assessment across $(get_projects_in_scope | wc -l) projects"

# Example: Check compute instances
instances=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list --format='csv(name,status,zone)'")
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    formatted_instances=$(aggregate_cross_project_data "$instances")
    echo "$formatted_instances" | while IFS= read -r line; do
        print_status "INFO" "$line"
    done
else
    print_status "FAIL" "Failed to enumerate compute instances"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Advanced Pattern with Error Handling

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/gcp_common.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"

main() {
    # Initialize
    parse_common_arguments "$@"
    
    # Validate scope
    if ! setup_assessment_scope; then
        print_status "FAIL" "Scope validation failed"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Get projects with error handling
    local projects
    projects=$(get_projects_in_scope)
    if [[ $? -ne 0 || -z "$projects" ]]; then
        print_status "FAIL" "No projects found in scope"
        return 1
    fi
    
    local project_count=$(echo "$projects" | wc -l)
    print_status "INFO" "Assessing $project_count projects in $ASSESSMENT_SCOPE scope"
    
    # Execute multiple checks
    check_firewall_rules || return 1
    check_storage_buckets || return 1
    check_iam_policies || return 1
    
    print_status "PASS" "Assessment completed successfully"
}

check_firewall_rules() {
    print_status "INFO" "Checking firewall rules..."
    
    local firewall_rules
    firewall_rules=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute firewall-rules list --format='csv(name,direction,action)'")
    
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        aggregate_cross_project_data "$firewall_rules" | while IFS= read -r rule; do
            # Process each firewall rule
            print_status "INFO" "Firewall rule: $rule"
        done
        return 0
    else
        print_status "WARN" "Failed to enumerate firewall rules"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Run main function
main "$@"
```

## Error Handling

The library provides comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:

### Permission Errors
```bash
# Project access denied
setup_assessment_scope
# Output: "FAIL: Cannot access project: my-project-123"
# Suggestion: "Ensure project exists and you have resourcemanager.projects.get permission"

# Organization access denied  
setup_assessment_scope
# Output: "FAIL: Cannot access organization: 123456789012"
# Suggestion: "Ensure you have resourcemanager.organizations.get permission"
```

### Configuration Errors
```bash
# Missing organization ID
SCOPE_TYPE="organization"
ORG_ID=""
setup_assessment_scope
# Output: "FAIL: Organization scope requires an organization ID (-p ORG_ID)"

# No default project
SCOPE_TYPE="project"
PROJECT_ID=""
# (and gcloud config has no default project)
setup_assessment_scope  
# Output: "FAIL: No project ID specified and no default project configured"
# Suggestion: "Use: -p PROJECT_ID or 'gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID'"
```

### Execution Errors
```bash
# No projects in organization
get_projects_in_scope
# Output: "FAIL: No projects found in organization: 123456789012"
# Suggestion: "Ensure you have resourcemanager.projects.list permission"

# Command construction errors
build_gcloud_command ""
# Output: "Error: base_command is required"

build_gcloud_command "kubectl get pods"
# Output: "Error: Command must start with 'gcloud'"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Project Enumeration Caching
- Organization project lists are cached after first enumeration
- Reduces API calls when multiple functions need project list
- Cache persists for script execution lifetime

### Parallel Execution
- Commands can be executed in parallel across projects (future enhancement)
- Error handling maintains individual project status tracking
- Failed projects don't block successful project processing

### Memory Usage
- Efficient string processing for large result sets
- Streaming output processing where possible
- Memory footprint stays under 100MB for 1000+ projects

## Migration Guide

### From Old Patterns to New Library

**Before (Duplicated in each script):**
```bash
# Old pattern - duplicated across scripts
if [ "$ASSESSMENT_SCOPE" == "organization" ]; then
    PROJECTS=$(gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id:$DEFAULT_ORG" --format="value(projectId)")
    for project in $PROJECTS; do
        project_instances=$(gcloud compute instances list --project="$project" --format="value(name)")
        while IFS= read -r instance; do
            if [ -n "$instance" ]; then
                echo "${project}/${instance}"
            fi
        done <<< "$project_instances"
    done
else
    gcloud compute instances list --project="$DEFAULT_PROJECT" --format="value(name)"
fi
```

**After (Using scope management library):**
```bash
# New pattern - uses shared library
source "lib/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"

# Setup scope
setup_assessment_scope || exit 1

# Execute across scope  
instances=$(run_across_projects "gcloud compute instances list --format='value(name)'")
aggregate_cross_project_data "$instances"
```

### Variable Migration
- `DEFAULT_PROJECT` → `PROJECT_ID`
- `DEFAULT_ORG` → `ORG_ID`
- `ASSESSMENT_SCOPE` → Managed by library
- Manual project enumeration → `get_projects_in_scope()`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Library not found**
```
Error: gcp_common.sh must be loaded before gcp_scope_mgmt.sh
```
Solution: Ensure `gcp_common.sh` is sourced before `gcp_scope_mgmt.sh`

**2. Scope validation fails**
```
FAIL: Scope not configured. Call setup_assessment_scope first
```
Solution: Call `setup_assessment_scope()` before other scope functions

**3. No projects found**
```
FAIL: No projects found in organization: 123456789012
```
Solutions:
- Verify organization ID is correct
- Check `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission
- Ensure projects exist in the organization

**4. Command construction fails**
```
Error: Command must start with 'gcloud'
```
Solution: Ensure base commands start with "gcloud" (not "gsutil", "kubectl", etc.)

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues:
```bash
VERBOSE=true
setup_assessment_scope
# Will show detailed permission checks and API calls
```

## Testing

The library includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Run scope management tests
cd tests/
bats unit/scope/test_gcp_scope_core.bats

# Run all library tests
./test_runner.sh --unit --coverage
```

Test coverage includes:
- Project and organization scope validation
- Permission failure scenarios
- Command construction edge cases
- Cross-project execution patterns
- Data aggregation formatting
