### Framework Integration Patterns

**Library Loading Pattern:**
```bash
# Replaces ~30 lines with 4 lines
LIB_DIR="$(dirname "$0")/../lib"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_common.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_permissions.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_html_report.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"
```

**Permission Registration Pattern:**
```bash
# Replaces ~60 lines with ~10 lines
register_required_permissions "$REQUIREMENT_NUMBER" \
    "compute.firewalls.list" \
    "compute.networks.list" \
    # ... additional permissions
```

**CLI Processing Pattern:**
```bash
# Replaces ~40 lines with 1 line
parse_common_cli_args "$@"
```

**Report Generation Pattern:**
```bash
# Replaces ~150 lines with ~5 lines
configure_html_report "$REQUIREMENT_NUMBER" "$REQUIREMENT_TITLE"
add_assessment_section "Section Title" "section_id"
generate_final_report "$output_file"
```

## Migration Template Development

### Standard Migration Pattern

Based on the pilot migration, the following template has been established for remaining scripts:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# PCI DSS Requirement X Compliance Check Script for GCP (Framework-Migrated Version)
# [Original script description and requirements]

# Framework Integration - Load all 4 shared libraries
LIB_DIR="$(dirname "$0")/../lib"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_common.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_permissions.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_html_report.sh"
source "$LIB_DIR/gcp_scope_mgmt.sh"

# Script-specific configuration
REQUIREMENT_NUMBER="X"
REQUIREMENT_TITLE="[Requirement Title]"

# Register required permissions
register_required_permissions "$REQUIREMENT_NUMBER" \
    "[permission1]" \
    "[permission2]" \
    # ... additional permissions

# Parse CLI arguments and validate environment
parse_common_cli_args "$@"
validate_gcp_environment || exit 1
check_all_permissions || prompt_continue_limited || exit 1

# Setup scope and configure reporting
setup_assessment_scope "$SCOPE" "$PROJECT_ID" "$ORG_ID"
configure_html_report "$REQUIREMENT_NUMBER" "$REQUIREMENT_TITLE"

# [Assessment functions - preserve original logic]

# Main execution with scope management
main() {
    local projects=$(enumerate_projects)
    local project_count=0
    
    while IFS= read -r project_data; do
        [[ -z "$project_data" ]] && continue
        setup_project_context "$project_data"
        assess_project "$(get_current_project_id)"
        ((project_count++))
    done <<< "$projects"
    
    generate_final_report "pci_requirementX_assessment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).html"
    success_log "Assessment complete! Projects assessed: $project_count"
}

main "$@"
```
